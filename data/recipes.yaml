  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 pound spaghetti
  - 4 ounces guanciale or pancetta
  - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for garnish
  - 12 ounces frozen or canned artichoke quarters, defrosted or drained
  - 6 large egg yolks, plus 4 yolks for an optional garnish
  - 1/4 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano, plus more for garnish
  Instructions: 'Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook the pasta according
    to package instructions until al dente.

    While the pasta cooks, make the sauce: Cut the guanciale into 1/4-inch-thick slabs
    and then 1-inch-long strips. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a large, deep skillet
    and heat over medium. Add the guanciale, reduce the heat to low and allow the
    guanciale to render until crisp, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove
    the guanciale from the skillet and reserve. Remove 1 tablespoon of the guanciale
    drippings to a small bowl and set aside.

    Add the artichokes to the skillet and cook until warmed, stirring carefully so
    they do not break apart. Stir in the cooked guanciale.

    Add the egg yolks, the cheese, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper to the
    small bowl with the reserved guanciale drippings and stir until combined.

    Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then, using tongs, transfer the cooked pasta to
    the skillet, mixing to incorporate with the artichokes and guanciale.

    While whisking, slowly drizzle 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water into the egg
    mixture until combined.

    Remove the pasta from the heat and add the egg mixture, tossing vigorously to
    coat. Add more reserved pasta water incrementally until the sauce is smooth and
    creamy.

    Divide the pasta among bowls and top with more grated cheese. If desired, place
    a raw egg yolk on top of each pasta nest. Top with a sprinkle of salt and pepper,
    and a drizzle of olive oil to finish.'

  Ingredients:
  - 1 pound paccheri pasta or other tubelike shape, such as penne or rigatoni
  - 8 ounces bacon, diced into 1/2-inch pieces
  - 1 pound cherry tomatoes, halved
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 5 ounces baby arugula
  - 1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano, plus more for serving
  - Flaky salt, for serving (optional)
  Instructions: 'Bring a large pot of well-salted water (2 heaping tablespoons kosher
    salt to about 7 quarts water) to a boil. Add pasta and cook until it is just under
    al dente, 1 minute less than package directions. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking
    water, and drain the pasta.

    Meanwhile, make the sauce: Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-low
    heat until crisp, stirring occasionally to make sure it does not burn, about 8
    minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate lined with paper
    towels. Turn heat to medium and add the tomatoes to the skillet, tossing them
    to coat in the bacon fat. Season with salt and pepper. As the moisture from the
    tomatoes releases, scrape any browned bits that have accumulated at the bottom
    of the pan (add a few tablespoons of the pasta water if you need to) and continue
    to cook until the tomatoes begin to fall apart, about 5 to 7 minutes more. Add
    half the cooked bacon back to the skillet and toss to combine.

    Increase the heat to medium-high and add the pasta directly to the skillet tossing
    to coat with the sauce. Add the arugula and 1/4 cup of the pasta water and carefully
    toss (you''ll have a very full pan) until the arugula wilts. Add the cheese and
    an additional 1/4 cup pasta water and toss together until the cheese emulsifies
    and the pasta is glossy with sauce. If needed, add another 1/4 cup pasta water
    to loosen the sauce.

    Serve in bowls and top with remaining bacon. Pass the grated Pecorino Romano at
    the table and season with flaky salt, if desired.'

  Ingredients:
  - Salt, as needed
  - 1 pound fusilli, farfalle or other short pasta
  - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
  - 1 large bunch scallions, thinly sliced, whites and greens separated
  - 4 fat garlic cloves, thinly sliced
  - 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving
  - 8 ounces cream cheese (1 cup), cubed
  - 6 ounces goat cheese, cubed
  - 2 (14-ounce) cans artichoke hearts (not marinated), drained and cut into 1-inch
    pieces
  - 2 cups canned fried onions
  - 6 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese (1 1/2 cups)
  - 1 cup chopped parsley
  - 1 cup chopped fresh dill
  - 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
  - 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
  Instructions: 'Heat oven to 425 degrees and bring a large pot of heavily salted

    shy of al dente. Reserve 3 cups pasta water, then drain.

    Meanwhile, in a large oven-proof skillet, heat oil in a large skillet over medium

  - 2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil, plus more for brushing the pan and drizzling
  - 2/3 cup lime juice (from about 5 limes), and zest of 1 lime
  - Kosher salt
  - 8 baby bell peppers or 1 medium bell pepper (any color will do), stemmed and thinly

  - Black pepper
  - 1 cup long-grain rice like jasmine or basmati
  - 1/2 cup full-fat coconut milk
  - 1 cup smooth, natural peanut butter
  - 1 tablespoon red miso
  - 1 tablespoon grated ginger
  - 1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional)
  - 2 teaspoons chopped habanero pepper, stem and seeds removed, or 1 tablespoon sambal
  - 2 tablespoons buckwheat honey or molasses
  - 2 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and sliced crosswise, 1/4-inch thick
  - 3 cups peppery greens, like arugula, mizuna or baby mustard greens
  - 2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
  Instructions: 'Heat the oven to 450 degrees and lightly brush a large rimmed sheet

  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 2 carrots, peeled and chopped
  - 2 onions, peeled and chopped
  - 4 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 cup red wine
  - "2 jalape\xF1o peppers, seeded and chopped"
  - 1 pound dry black beans (do not soak)
  - 2 quarts mild vegetable or chicken stock

  - 1 small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
  - Freshly squeezed juice of 2 limes
  - Salt
  - Sour cream or Mexican crema
  - Whole cilantro leaves
  - Thinly sliced fresh chiles
  - Sliced avocado
  Instructions: "Empty the can of chiles into a blender or food processor. Pur\xE9\

  - 1 1/2 teaspoons/9 grams kosher salt
  - 1/2 teaspoon/5 grams baking soda
  Instructions: 'Heat oven to 375 degrees. On the stovetop, in a 11- or 12-inch skillet
    (ovenproof and preferably cast-iron), melt the butter over medium heat. Cook,
    swirling pan to lightly coat sides and bottom, until the foam subsides and the
    butter turns a deep nut brown. (Watch carefully to see that it does not burn.)

    Pour brown butter into a large bowl. (Do not wipe out the pan.) Whisk the maple
    syrup into the butter, then whisk in buttermilk. The mixture should be cool to
    the touch; if not, let cool before whisking in the eggs. Then whisk in the cornmeal,
    flours, baking powder, salt and baking soda.

    If the skillet is no longer hot (cast iron retains heat longer than other metals),
    reheat it briefly on the stove for a few minutes. Scrape batter back into it.
    Bake until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into it emerges clean,
    30 to 40 minutes. Cool in the skillet for 10 minutes before slicing.'

Bulgur, Spinach and Tomato Casserole:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/05/science/04recipehealth/04recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1 cup coarse (#3) bulgur
  - Salt to taste
  - 1 28-ounce can chopped tomatoes with juice
  - 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
  - 3 plump garlic cloves, minced
  - 1/4 teaspoon sugar
  - 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice or cinnamon (to taste)
  - Freshly ground pepper
  - 1 12-ounce bunch spinach, stemmed and washed thoroughly in 2 changes of water,
    or 2 6-ounce bags baby spinach
  - 2 teaspoons dried mint or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
  - 1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas (1 can, drained and rinsed) (optional)
  - "2 ounces Gruy\xE8re, or 1 ounce each Gruy\xE8re and Parmesan, grated (1/2 cup)"
  Instructions: 'Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the bulgur
    and salt to taste, reduce the heat, cover and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, until the
    water is absorbed. Remove from the heat, uncover and place a clean dish towel
    over the pan, then replace the lid. Allow to sit undisturbed for 10 minutes or
    longer. Transfer to a large bowl.

    Pulse the tomatoes with their juice in a food processor. Heat 1 tablespoon of
    the olive oil over medium heat in a large, wide skillet or a shallow 3-quart saucepan
    and add the garlic. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds, and add
    the tomatoes, sugar, salt to taste, and allspice or cinnamon. Bring to a simmer,
    reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the tomatoes have cooked down
    to a fragrant sauce, about 20 minutes. Taste, adjust salt and add freshly ground
    pepper.

    Steam the spinach until it wilts, 1 to 2 minutes, rinse briefly with cold water
    and squeeze out excess water. Do this by the handful to get out all the water.
    Chop coarsely. Add to the bulgur. Add the mint and the chickpeas if using, 1 tablespoon
    of olive oil and 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce and toss together.

    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Oil a 2-quart gratin or baking dish. Spread the
    bulgur mixture in the dish in an even layer. Top with the remaining tomato sauce.
    Sprinkle on the cheese. Drizzle on the last tablespoon of olive oil. Bake 30 minutes,
    or until the top is lightly browned. Remove from the heat and allow to sit for
    10 minutes before serving.'

    coat the pasta, adding a teaspoon or two of olive oil and a bit of the pasta cooking
    water to thin the sauce if necessary. The sauce should cling to the pasta and
    be creamy but not watery.

  Ingredients:
  - 1 large Gala apple, quartered
  - 1 medium yellow onion, quartered and peeled
  - 1 (8-ounce/226-gram) piloncillo cone
  - 3 cinnamon sticks, preferably Ceylon
  - 4 whole cloves
  - Pinch of salt
  - 3 medium bananas
  - 1 tablespoon vegan butter
  - 1 large baguette or 3 to 4 large bolillos or birotes (about 14 ounces total),

  Ingredients:
  - 1/4 cup olive oil
  - 6 large shallots, very thinly sliced
  - 5 garlic cloves, 4 thinly sliced, 1 finely chopped
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste
  - 1 (2-ounce) can anchovy fillets (about 12), drained
  - 1 (4.5-ounce) tube or (6-ounce) can of tomato paste (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup)
  - 10 ounces pasta
  - 1 cup parsley, leaves and tender stems, finely chopped
  - Flaky sea salt
  Instructions: 'Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium high.
    Add shallots and thinly sliced garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Cook,
    stirring occasionally, until the shallots have become totally softened and caramelized
    with golden-brown fried edges, 15 to 20 minutes.

    Add red-pepper flakes and anchovies. (No need to chop the anchovies; they will
    dissolve on their own.) Stir to melt the anchovies into the shallots, about 2
    minutes.

    Add tomato paste and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly to
    prevent any scorching, until the tomato paste has started to cook in the oil a
    bit, caramelizing at the edges and going from bright red to a deeper brick red
    color, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer about half the mixture to
    a resealable container, leaving the rest behind. (These are your leftovers to
    be used elsewhere: in another batch of pasta or smeared onto roasted vegetables,
    spooned over fried eggs or spread underneath crispy chicken thighs.)

    To serve, cook pasta according to package instructions in a large pot of salted
    boiling water until very al dente (perhaps more al dente than usual). Transfer
    to Dutch oven with remaining shallot mixture (or a skillet if you are using the
    leftover portion) and 1 cup pasta water. Cook over medium-high heat, swirling
    the skillet to coat each piece of pasta, using a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape
    up any bits on the bottom, until pasta is thick and sauce has reduced and is sticky,
    but not saucy, 3 to 5 minutes.

    In a small bowl, combine parsley and finely chopped garlic clove, and season with
    flaky salt and pepper. Divide pasta among bowls, or transfer to one large serving
    bowl, and top with parsley mixture and a bit more red-pepper flakes, if you like.'

  Ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  - 2 pounds zucchini, coarsely grated (about 3 large zucchini)
  - 8 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
  - 1/2 cup basil leaves, stems reserved, plus more for serving
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 pound ridged or curly pasta (like medium shells or casarecce)
  - 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan or pecorino (about 1/2 ounce), plus more for serving
  - 1 tablespoon lemon juice
  Instructions: "In a large (at least 12-inch) cast iron skillet over medium-high\
    \ heat, melt the butter and oil. When it\u2019s foaming, add the zucchini, garlic,\
    \ the basil stems and half the basil leaves. Season with 1 1/4 teaspoons salt\

    \ to sizzle, 7 to 10 minutes.\nContinue to cook until the zucchini is very soft,\
    \ dark green, and reduced to about 1 cup, another 20 to 25 minutes. When you see\
    \ a build up of browned bits on the skillet, add a couple tablespoons of water\
    \ and stir, scraping up the browned bits. Repeat anytime more browning occurs.\
    \ If you see burning, deglaze with water and lower the heat. (Caramelized zucchini\
    \ can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to a week; it also freezes well.)\n\
    Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When the zucchini is about\

Cast-Iron Steak:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/12/multimedia/recipelab-steak/recipelab-steak-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - Coarse salt, such as kosher salt or Maldon sea salt
  - "1 or 2 boneless beef steaks, 1 inch thick (about 2 pounds total), such as strip,\
    \ rib-eye, flat iron, chuck-eye, hanger or skirt (preferably \u201Coutside\u201D\
    \ skirt)"
  - Black pepper (optional)
  Instructions: "Remove packaging and pat meat dry with paper towels. Line a plate\
    \ with paper towels, place meat on top and set aside to dry further and come to\
    \ cool room temperature (30 to 60 minutes, depending on the weather). Turn occasionally;\
    \ replace paper towels as needed.\nPlace a heavy skillet, preferably cast-iron,\
    \ on the stove and sprinkle lightly but evenly with about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon\
    \ salt. Turn heat to high under pan. Pat both sides of steak dry again.\nWhen\
    \ pan is smoking hot, 5 to 8 minutes, pat steak dry again and place in pan. (If\
    \ using two steaks, cook in two batches.)\nLet steak sizzle for 1 minute, then\
    \ use tongs to flip it over, moving raw side of steak around in pan so both sides\
    \ are salted. Press down gently to ensure even contact between steak and pan.\
    \ Keep cooking over very high heat, flipping steak every 30 seconds. After it\u2019\
    s been turned a few times, sprinkle in two pinches salt. If using pepper, add\
    \ it now.\nWhen steak has contracted in size and developed a dark-brown crust,\
    \ about 4 minutes total, check for doneness. To the touch, meat should feel softly\
    \ springy but not squishy. If using an instant-read thermometer, insert into side\
    \ of steak. For medium-rare meat, 120 to 125 degrees is ideal: Steak will continue\
    \ cooking after being removed from heat.\nRemove steak to a cutting board and\
    \ tent lightly with foil. Let rest 5 minutes.\nServe in pieces or thickly slice\
    \ on the diagonal, cutting away from your body and with the top edge of the knife\
    \ leaning toward your body. If cooking skirt or hanger steak, make sure to slice\
    \ across the grain of the meat."

  Ingredients:
  - 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
  - 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
  - 3 cups panko or plain unseasoned bread crumbs
  - Kosher salt, as needed
  - Black pepper, as needed
  - 1 medium head cauliflower, trimmed and cut into 2-inch florets
  - 1/2 cup olive oil, for frying (more as needed)
  - 5 cups Simple Tomato Sauce (see recipe)
  - 1 cup finely grated Parmesan, preferably Parmigiano-Reggiano
  - 1/2 pound fresh mozzarella, torn into bite-size pieces
  Instructions: 'Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Place flour, eggs and panko into three
    wide, shallow bowls. Season each generously with salt and pepper. Dip a cauliflower
    piece first in flour, then eggs, then coat with panko. Repeat with remaining cauliflower.

    Fill a large skillet with 1/2-inch oil. Place over medium-high heat. When oil
    is hot, fry cauliflower in batches, turning halfway through, until golden brown.
    Transfer fried cauliflower pieces to a paper towel-lined plate.

    Spoon a thin layer of sauce over the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Sprinkle
    one-third of the Parmesan over sauce. Scatter half cauliflower mixture over the
    Parmesan and top with half the mozzarella pieces. Top with half the remaining
    sauce, sprinkle with another third of the Parmesan and repeat layering, ending
    with a final layer of sauce and Parmesan.

    Transfer pan to oven and bake until cheese is golden and casserole is bubbling,
    about 40 minutes. Let cool a few minutes before serving.'

  - 4 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks
  - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
  - 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (optional)
  - 3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
  - Pinch of salt
  - 1 loaf challah bread (about 1 pound), cut into 1 1/4-inch slices

    Arrange challah slices in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour custard
    on top, and let sit at room temperature, uncovered, for 30 minutes, so the bread
    can absorb the custard, carefully flipping bread slices halfway through.

    In a medium bowl, whisk together sugar, cinnamon and remaining 1/4 teaspoon cardamom.
    Set aside.

    Heat a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium, then add 2 tablespoons
    butter and let it melt. Place 2 to 3 pieces soaked challah in skillet, making
    sure to not crowd the pan. Cook until golden on bottom, 4 to 5 minutes.

    Sprinkle a little of the cinnamon-sugar mixture on top of each slice, then flip
    and cook until bottom is glazed and browned, another 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer
    to serving plates, glazed-side up. Repeat with remaining butter, challah and cinnamon
    sugar. Serve warm, with your choice of toppings.'

Cheesy Pan Pizza:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/27/magazine/28mag-eat/28mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons/240 grams all-purpose flour
  - 3/4 cup/180 milliliters lukewarm water
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 1/2 teaspoon instant or active dry yeast
  - 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 6 ounces mozzarella, grated (about 1 1/4 loosely packed cups)
  - 1/2 cup/120 grams tomato sauce or pizza sauce
  - Freshly grated hard cheese, such as Parmesan or pecorino, for garnish (optional)
  - Fresh herbs, such as basil, marjoram or oregano, for garnish (optional)
  Instructions: "Prepare the dough: Measure the flour, water, olive oil, salt and\
    \ yeast into a large mixing bowl. Mix together with your hand or a dough scraper\
    \ until it forms a shaggy, sticky ball with no dry patches. Cover the bowl using\
    \ a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for 5 minutes.\nWet your\
    \ hand, and reach down between the side of the bowl and the dough, as though you\
    \ were going to lift the dough out, but instead of lifting, stretch the bottom\
    \ of the dough up, and fold it over the top. Repeat three more times, turning\
    \ the bowl 90 degrees each time. Cover the bowl again for 5 minutes, then repeat\
    \ the folding-and-resting process three more times. After the fourth time, cover\
    \ the bowl, and let the dough rest, undisturbed, for 40 minutes, then transfer\
    \ the bowl to the fridge for at least 12 hours or up to 72 hours.\nAbout 3 hours\
    \ before you want to eat the pizza, get ready for assembly: Pour the olive oil\
    \ into a well-seasoned 9- or 10-inch cast-iron skillet, and use your fingers to\
    \ coat the inside of the pan, including the sides. Transfer the dough to the pan,\
    \ and turn it once to coat both sides with the oil. After coating the dough in\
    \ oil, press the dough to the edges of the pan, dimpling it with your fingertips.\
    \ If the dough shrinks back, cover it and let it rest for about 15 minutes, then\
    \ repeat the pressing and dimpling. At this point, you should be able to smush\
    \ the dough out and into the edges of the pan, but if not, give it one more 15-minute\
    \ rest before trying again. Cover the dough, and let it rise for 2 hours at room\
    \ temperature. It will look soft and jiggle when you gently shake the pan.\nPlace\
    \ one rack at the bottom of the oven and one toward the top (about 4 to 5 inches\
    \ from the top heating element), then heat the oven to 450 degrees. When you\u2019\
    re ready to bake the pizza, sprinkle a scant 1 cup mozzarella evenly over the\
    \ crust. Cover the entire dough so none is showing, then dollop small spoonfuls\
    \ of the sauce over the cheese. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella on top, and\
    \ bake on the bottom rack of the oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until the cheese is\
    \ bubbling and the bottom and edges of the crust are a rich golden brown. (Use\
    \ a spatula to check the bottom.) If the bottom is brown but the top still seems\
    \ pale, transfer the pizza to the top rack, and bake for 2 to 4 minutes longer.\
    \ On the other hand, if the top seems fine but the bottom\u2019s not browned to\
    \ your liking, leave the pizza on the bottom rack for another 2 to 4 minutes.\n\
    Remove the pizza from the oven, and place the pan on a heatproof surface. Carefully\
    \ run a table knife or spatula between the edge of the pizza and side of the pan\
    \ to prevent the cheese from sticking as it cools. Let the pizza cool very briefly;\
    \ as soon as you feel comfortable doing so, carefully transfer it from the pan\
    \ to a cooling rack or cutting surface. If garnishing with hard cheese and herbs,\
    \ add those now. Serve the pizza anywhere from medium-hot to warm, and use kitchen\
    \ shears or a large pair of scissors to cut it into wedges."

    \ and salt in a colander. Let stand for 10 minutes, then squeeze the greens in\
    \ the colander over the sink to release as much liquid as possible. Transfer the\
    \ greens mixture to a large bowl. Add the drained tofu, squeezing it to crumble\
    \ into bits as you add it, then mix evenly with the greens. Add the celery, soy\
    \ sauce and chile crisp, and stir until evenly mixed. Taste, and add more soy\
    \ sauce and chile crisp, if you\u2019d like. The filling on its own should be\
    \ very flavorful because the wrappers are not seasoned at all.\nSet up a dumpling\
    \ assembly line with the bowl of filling, wrappers and a small bowl of water.\
    \ Using a dessert spoon or other small spoon, scoop a mound of filling, then press\
    \ it against the side of the bowl into a tiny football. Set the filling in the\
    \ center of one wrapper. Use your fingertip to dampen the edges with water. Bring\
    \ together the sides over the filling to enclose in a half-moon. Pinch the center\
    \ together, then press the edges together to seal, pleating decoratively if you\u2019\
    d like. Sit the dumpling upright on your work surface. Repeat with the remaining\
    \ filling and wrappers. Cook immediately or freeze in a single layer on a rimmed\
    \ baking sheet until hard, then transfer to airtight containers and freeze for\
    \ up to 3 months.\nYou can cook as many or as few dumplings at a time as you\u2019\
    d like. Choose your pan size accordingly: An 8-inch skillet will fit 8 to 10;\
    \ a 10-inch will fit 14 to 16. When ready to cook, coat a well-seasoned cast-iron\
    \ pan or nonstick skillet with a thin, even layer of oil. Arrange the dumplings\
    \ in the pan, pleated side up, spacing 1/3 inch apart, and filling the pan. Add\
    \ enough cold water to the pan to come 1/3 inch up the sides (about 1/4 cup for\
    \ an 8-inch pan; 1/2 cup for a 10-inch).\nCover the skillet and cook over medium\
    \ until the rapid firecracker popping diminishes to a steady, low crackle, indicating\
    \ that all the water has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Uncover and check to see\
    \ if the bottoms are browned and the dough is slightly translucent all the way\
    \ to the top. If so, remove from the heat. If not, cook uncovered 1 to 2 minutes\
    \ longer. Let stand for a minute so the dumplings release from the skillet naturally.\
    \ Transfer to a plate, browned side up. Make your own dipping sauce with any combination\
    \ of soy sauce, chile crisp, vinegar and sesame oil, and enjoy with the hot dumplings."

  - 4 scallions, thinly sliced crosswise (optional)
  - 1 fresh rosemary sprig (optional)
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
  - 1/2 cup fine or coarse yellow cornmeal
  - 2 teaspoons baking powder
  - 1 cup sour cream
  - 2 large eggs
  - 1 1/2 cups freshly grated Cheddar or Parmesan
  Instructions: 'Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Add 4 tablespoons butter to a 9-by-13-inch
    pan or other 3-quart casserole dish and transfer to the oven. Once the butter
    has melted, about 5 minutes, take the pan out of the oven and let cool.

    In a medium pot, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high. Add
    the corn, scallions and rosemary, if using, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds
    of black pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the corn starts to give
    off some liquid and softens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and discard the

    in herbs. Taste, and add more salt and lemon, if needed.

    To serve, top with a dusting of ground cinnamon (if you like), flaky salt, a lot
    of black pepper, and more olive oil and herbs. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.'

  Ingredients:
  - 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 10 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
  - 1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped
  - 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)
  - 2 1/2 pounds mixed hearty greens (like kale, spinach, mustard greens or collard
    greens), stems removed and leaves torn into large pieces
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
  - 2 cups heavy cream
  - 1 teaspoon hot sauce
  - 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan
  - 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
  - 1 egg, beaten
  Instructions: 'Heat the oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment
    or foil.

    In a medium (10-inch) oven-proof skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add
    the garlic, shallot and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened
    but not browned, 5 to 6 minutes.

    Add a handful of the greens and season lightly with salt and pepper. Using tongs,
    toss the greens in the butter until wilted. Repeat, making sure to season each
    batch, until all the greens are added and wilted. (They will eventually all fit.)

    Stir in the flour until it disappears into the greens, then add the cream and
    hot sauce and stir well to combine. Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat and
    stir in the Parmesan. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

    On a lightly floured work surface or the bottom of another baking sheet, use a
    lightly floured rolling pin, roll and trim the puff pastry into a 12-inch circle.
    If you find the pastry contracts when you roll it, give it a few minutes between
    each roll to relax a little.

    Transfer the skillet to the lined baking sheet. Drape the puff pastry over the
    skillet so that there is about 1/2-inch hang over on all sides. (Trim any sides
    that have more than an inch.) Brush the beaten egg onto the puff pastry, then
    cut four large slits into the pastry. Bake until the puff pastry is puffed and
    golden brown, about 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees and
    bake until the pastry is cooked through and the filling is bubbling, 30 to 35
    minutes. (If the pastry is getting too dark, cover with foil.) Let sit for a few
    minutes before diving in.'

  - 4 ounces Pecorino Romano, coarsely grated (1 cup)
  - 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard powder
  - 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
  - Pinch of ground cayenne

    Whisk in the milk. Raise the heat to high and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly,
    then immediately reduce the heat to low and continue simmering until the sauce
    lightly coats the back of a spoon, 2 to 5 minutes. At this stage, the sauce should
    be smooth but relatively loose. Take the pot off the heat.

    To the pot, add the Cheddar, Velveeta, Pecorino Romano, mustard powder, onion
    powder and cayenne, and season generously with salt and black pepper. Whisk until

  Ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil, more as needed
  - 1 shallot or small onion, chopped
  - 1 tablespoon minced garlic
  - 2 cups crimini, shiitake or button mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed and sliced
  - 1/2 pound cut pasta like gemelli or penne, or long pasta broken into bits
  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 1/2 cup dry white wine or water
  - 3 to 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock
  - 2 boneless chicken thighs, diced
  - Chopped fresh parsley, optional
  - Freshly grated Parmesan, optional
  Instructions: "Put 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium\
    \ heat. When hot, add shallot, garlic and mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally,\
    \ until mushrooms soften and begin to brown on edges, about 10 minutes. Add pasta\
    \ and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is glossy and coated with oil, 2 to\
    \ 3 minutes. Add a little salt and pepper, then wine. Stir and let liquid bubble\
    \ away.\nLadle stock into skillet 1/2 cup or so at a time, stirring after each\
    \ addition and every minute or so. When liquid is just about evaporated, add more.\
    \ Mixture should be neither soupy nor dry. Keep heat at medium and stir frequently.\n\
    Begin tasting pasta 10 minutes after you add it; you want it to be tender but\
    \ with a tiny bit of crunch. When pasta is about 3 to 4 minutes away from being\
    \ done, add chicken and stir to combine. Continue to cook until chicken is done\
    \ \u2014 it will be white on inside when cut \u2014 and pasta is how you like\
    \ it. Taste, adjust seasoning, garnish with parsley and Parmesan if using, and\
    \ serve."

  Ingredients:
  - 1/2 cup roughly chopped chives
  - 1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems
  - 1/2 cup tightly packed basil leaves
  - 1/2 cup olive oil
  - Squeeze of lemon
  - Kosher salt, to taste
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
  - 2 (15-ounce) cans white beans, like butter beans or cannellini, rinsed and drained
  - Kosher salt and black pepper

  Ingredients:
  - 5 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or sunflower, plus more as needed
  - 3 slices thick-cut bacon, in 1/2-inch pieces (about 3 ounces)
  - 1 small bunch scallions, whites and greens separated, sliced
  - 4 cups shredded cabbage (from about 1/2 small head)
  - Salt

  - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
  - 2 (12- to 18-ounce) packages shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi
  - 1/4 cup unsalted butter
  - 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
  - 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving

  - 2 pints small tomatoes, such as cherry, grape or Sungold
  - 1/4 cup thinly sliced or torn basil leaves (optional), plus more for serving
  - 8 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut or torn into 1/2-inch pieces
  Instructions: 'Heat the broiler with a rack about 6 inches from the heat source.

    In a large (12-inch) skillet on the stovetop, heat enough olive oil to lightly
    coat the bottom of the pan (about 1 tablespoon) over medium-high. Add half the
    gnocchi to the pan, breaking up any that are stuck together. Cover with a lid

    oil.

    Add the butter to the skillet and cook over medium-high, stirring often, until
    golden-brown and toasty, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the garlic, red-pepper flakes, 1
    1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper, reducing the heat slightly if necessary
    to avoid scorching. Add the tomatoes and 3 tablespoons water and cook, shaking
    the pan occasionally, until the tomatoes have softened and the liquid has slightly

Crispy Rice With Shrimp, Bacon and Corn:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/21/dining/ko-crispy-rice-shrimp/ko-crispy-rice-shrimp-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  - 1 pound peeled and deveined shrimp, patted very dry
  - Kosher salt and ground black pepper
  - 4 strips bacon
  - 3 ears corn
  - 6 scallions
  - 1 cup grape tomatoes, or 1 large chopped juicy tomato
  - 4 cups cooked rice
  Instructions: 'Heat oil in large cast-iron skillet or other heavy skillet over high
    heat. Season shrimp with salt and pepper. Add to the hot oil in a single layer
    and sear until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.

    Turn heat down to medium-low and add the bacon in a single layer. Cook, turning
    to evenly brown, until crisp, about 10 minutes.

    While the bacon browns, shuck the corn and cut off the kernels. You should end
    up with about 3 1/2 cups. Thinly slice the scallions and set aside some greens
    for garnish. Cut the tomatoes in half. (If the bacon is done cooking before you''re
    finished slicing, remove the pan from the heat for a moment.)

    Drain the bacon on paper towels, leaving as much liquid as possible in the skillet.
    Turn the heat up to medium-high and add the corn, scallions, and a pinch of salt
    to the skillet. Cook, stirring, until the scallions just wilt, about 1 minute.

    Add the rice and stir until well-mixed and heated through, about 3 minutes. Press
    the rice evenly across the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Let cook, without
    stirring, as the rice and corn begin to crackle, until you smell a toasty scent
    and the rice browns, about 5 minutes. You can lift up a section of rice to peek
    and see if a golden brown crust has developed.

    Remove from the heat and divide the rice mixture among four bowls, scattering
    the tomatoes, shrimp and accumulated juices on top of each. (Alternatively, serve
    rice directly from the pan, with tomatoes and shrimp on top.) Season to taste
    with salt and pepper. Crumble the bacon all over and garnish with the reserved
    scallions.'

  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/01/dining/26tofurex1/26tofurex1-articleLarge-v2.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1 (14-ounce) block firm or extra-firm tofu, drained
  - 3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed, vegetable or canola, plus more as
    needed
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 3/4 pound snap peas, trimmed
  - 1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated (about 2 tablespoons)
  - 2 garlic cloves, grated
  - 1 (13-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk (light or full-fat)
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 2 teaspoons molasses, dark brown sugar or honey
  - 1/2 cup toasted cashews
  - 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
  - 4 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
  - 1/4 cup mint leaves, torn if large
  - 1/2 to 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)
  - Rice or any steamed grain, for serving
  Instructions: 'Slice the tofu in half horizontally, and leave on paper towels to
    dry any excess liquid.

    In a medium skillet or cast-iron pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high until
    it shimmers. Season both sides of the tofu with salt and black pepper, place in
    the pan and sear without moving until tofu is browned and golden on both sides,
    turning once halfway through, about 8 minutes total. Move the tofu to a plate.

    Add 1 tablespoon oil to the pan, and add the snap peas. Cook, stirring occasionally,
    until blistered and just tender, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and move to
    a bowl.

    Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, add the ginger and garlic, and cook until
    fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the coconut milk, soy sauce and molasses.
    Simmer, stirring frequently until the sauce reduces and its color deepens to a
    dark brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. It should coat a spoon without running right
    off. Stir in the cashews, break the tofu into 1-inch pieces and toss in the pan
    to coat with sauce. Remove from heat, and taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary.

    Toss the snap peas with the rice vinegar, scallions, mint and red-pepper flakes,
    if using. Divide among plates, along with the tofu and cashews. Serve with rice
    or any steamed grain.'

  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
  - 1 1/2 pounds fresh udon noodles (vacuum-sealed)
  - 1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola
  - 1 yellow onion, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
  - 3 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
  - 3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
  - 6 cups vegetarian dashi (see Tip) or vegetable stock
  - 2 teaspoons soy sauce or tamari
  - 1 teaspoon granulated sugar

  - 1 tablespoon garam masala
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne
  Instructions: "Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, add the udon and cook\

    \ saucepan over medium heat. Add the butter and allow it to melt completely. Add\
    \ the flour and whisk until smooth. Cook, whisking constantly, for 4 to 5 minutes,\
    \ until the roux turns a light caramel color. Whisk in the curry powder, garam\
    \ masala and ground cayenne. Remove from the heat and set aside.\nPlace the large\
    \ pot from Step 1 over medium-high heat and add the neutral oil. Add the onion\

  Ingredients:
  - 2 cups all-purpose flour
  - 2 teaspoons baking powder
  - 1/4 teaspoon salt
  - 1 tablespoon sugar, optional
  - 2 eggs
  - 1 1/2 to 2 cups milk
  - 2 tablespoons melted and cooled butter (optional), plus unmelted butter for cooking,
    or use neutral oil
  Instructions: 'Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. In a bowl,
    mix together dry ingredients. Beat eggs into 1 1/2 cups milk, then stir in 2 tablespoons
    melted cooled butter, if using it. Gently stir this mixture into dry ingredients,
    mixing only enough to moisten flour; don''t worry about a few lumps. If batter
    seems thick, add a little more milk.

    Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or skillet. When butter foam
    subsides or oil shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle or skillet, making pancakes
    of any size you like. Adjust heat as necessary; usually, first batch will require
    higher heat than subsequent batches. Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface
    and bottoms brown, after 2 to 4 minutes.

    Cook until second side is lightly browned. Serve, or hold on an ovenproof plate
    in a 200-degree oven for up to 15 minutes.'

"FOOD\u2019s Amazing Cilantro Tofu Sandwich":
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/31/science/30recipehealth/30recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - A 1-pound block of organic extra-firm tofu (find one that is not too dry)
  - 3 tablespoons soy sauce, preferably tamari
  - 1/2 tablespoon minced ginger
  - 1 garlic clove, minced
  - 1/2 tablespoon minced shallot
  - "1/4 teaspoon minced jalape\xF1o"
  - 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground
  - 1 1/2 tablespoons honey
  - 2 1/4 teaspoons lime juice
  - 1/2 teaspoon lime zest
  - 3 tablespoons canola oil
  - 1/2 generous bunch cilantro, finely chopped
  - 1 large ear white corn
  - 1/4 large red bell pepper, roasted
  - 1/4 large yellow bell pepper, roasted
  - 1/4 generous bunch cilantro, finely chopped
  - Pinch of cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground
  - Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
  - 1 4-ounce slice of tofu
  - 1/4 large or 1/2 small Hass avocado, thinly sliced
  - 1/2 to 3/4 cup corn relish
  - Sliced heirloom or good roma tomatoes, in season only
  - 2 slices seeded sandwich bread
  - 2 teaspoons Vegenaise
  - Arugula
  Instructions: 'Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Pat the tofu dry with paper towels
    and cut laterally into 4 equal squares, approximately 1/3 inch wide. They should
    be just the right size for the sandwich bread.

    Line a sheet pan with parchment. In a large, wide bowl, whisk together all of
    the ingredients for the marinade. Pat each square of tofu with paper towels, then
    dip into the marinade, making sure to coat both sides. Transfer to the baking
    sheet.

    Bake the tofu for 7 to 10 minutes, until the edges are just beginning to color
    and the marinade sets on the surface of the tofu. Remove from the oven and allow
    to cool.

    Meanwhile, make the corn relish. Grill the corn until it colors lightly, and allow
    to cool. Remove the kernels from the cob. Peel, seed and dice the roasted peppers.
    Combine peppers, corn and remaining relish ingredients in a medium bowl. Salt
    and pepper to taste.

    For each sandwich, spread a thin coating of Vegenaise on each slice of bread.
    Top the bottom slice with a piece of baked marinated tofu. Fan thin slices of
    avocado over the tofu (the avocado helps the relish adhere to the sandwich). Top
    the avocado with 1/2 to 3/4 cup relish. Top the relish with slices of heirloom
    or good roma tomatoes and a handful of arugula. Top with the second slice of bread.'

Farro With Mushrooms:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/dining/mrs-farro-mushrooms-horizontal/mrs-farro-mushrooms-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1/2 ounce (1/2 cup, approximately) dried porcini mushrooms
  - 1 quart chicken stock or vegetable stock
  - 1 1/2 cups farro
  - 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
  - 1/2 cup finely chopped onion
  - 1 pound cremini mushrooms or wild mushrooms (or a mixture of the two), cleaned,
    trimmed and sliced
  - Salt to taste
  - 2 large garlic cloves, green shoots removed, minced
  - 2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
  - 1/2 cup dry white wine
  - Freshly ground pepper to taste
  - 1 to 2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (1/4 to 1/2 cup)
  - 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
  Instructions: 'Place the farro in a bowl, and pour on enough hot water to cover
    by an inch. Let soak while you prepare the remaining ingredients. Drain.

    Place the dried mushrooms in a large Pyrex measuring cup or bowl, and pour in
    2 cups boiling water. Let sit 30 minutes.

    Drain the mushrooms through a strainer set over a bowl and lined with cheesecloth
    or a paper towel. Squeeze the mushrooms over the strainer, then rinse in several
    changes of water to remove grit. Chop coarsely if the pieces are large and set
    aside. Add the broth from the mushrooms to the stock. You should have 6 cups (add
    water if necessary). Place in a saucepan, and bring to a simmer. Season with salt
    to taste.

    Heat the oil over medium heat in a large, heavy nonstick skillet. Add the onion.
    Cook, stirring, until it begins to soften, about three minutes. Add the fresh
    mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until they begin to soften and sweat. Add salt to taste,
    the garlic and rosemary. Continue to cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms
    are tender, about five minutes. Add the farro and reconstituted dried mushrooms.
    Cook, stirring, until the grains of farro are separate and beginning to crackle,
    about two minutes. Stir in the wine and cook, stirring until the wine has been
    absorbed. Add all but about 1 cup of the stock, and bring to a simmer. Cover and
    simmer 50 minutes or until the farro is tender; some of the grains will be beginning
    to splay. Remove the lid, and stir vigorously from time to time. Taste and adjust
    seasoning. There should be some liquid remaining in the pot but not too much.
    If the farro is submerged in stock, raise the heat and cook until there is just
    enough to moisten the grains, like a sauce. If there is not, stir in the remaining
    stock. If not serving right away, cover and let stand. Just before serving, bring
    back to a simmer, add the Parmesan, parsley and pepper, and stir together. Remove
    from the heat and serve.'

  Ingredients:
  - 3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour
  - 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
  - 1 tablespoon baking powder
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
  - 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
  - 1/4 teaspoon sweet or hot paprika
  - 1/2 cup/115 grams cold unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into 1/2-inch cubes, plus
    6 tablespoons/85 grams melted unsalted butter
  - 8 ounces/225 grams sharp or extra-sharp Cheddar, shredded (about 2 packed cups)
  - 1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk
  - 1 large egg
  Instructions: "Arrange the oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven\
    \ and heat the oven to 375 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\n\
    In a medium bowl, stir the flour, sugar, baking powder, garlic powder, salt and\
    \ paprika to combine. Add the 1/2 cup cubed butter and toss until each piece is\
    \ coated completely in flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your hands to rub\
    \ the butter into the flour, continuing to work the mixture until the butter is\
    \ almost fully blended into the dough. There can still be a few larger pieces\
    \ of butter, but none should be larger than a pea. If the butter feels soft or\
    \ melty at any point, refrigerate the mixture in the bowl for 15 minutes before\
    \ continuing.\nStir in 1 1/2 cups/170 grams of the cheese into the flour mixture.\
    \ Make a well in the center of the bowl. In a liquid measuring cup or in a small\
    \ bowl with a spout, whisk the buttermilk and egg until well combined. Pour the\
    \ mixture into the medium bowl and, using a wooden spoon, stir until the mixture\
    \ is combined. Near the end, you may have to fold it over itself a few times in\
    \ the bowl to make sure it\u2019s uniformly combined. (Resist the urge to use\
    \ your hands so that the mixture doesn\u2019t get too soft or compressed.)\nScoop\
    \ the dough into 12 even portions (about 1/2 cup/80 grams each) onto the prepared\

    \ (about 2 teaspoons per biscuit).\nTransfer to the oven and bake the biscuits\
    \ for 15 minutes, then brush each biscuit with butter again, and rotate the pans\
    \ between the oven racks. Continue to bake until the biscuits are light golden\

  Ingredients:
  - 1 pound extra-firm tofu, cut into 1/2-inch slices
  - 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  - 1 tablespoon unsalted butter or vegan butter
  - 1 tablespoon tamari
  - 1/2 cup barbecue sauce
  Instructions: 'Two and a half hours before serving, start drying out the tofu: Place
    the slices in a single layer between clean, dry dish towels or double layers of
    paper towels. Press to remove water from the tofu, and let stand for 2 hours,
    replacing the soaked towels once or twice, until there is very little water left
    in the tofu. (You can press and dry the tofu quickly, and use it immediately,
    but it will be less crisp.)

    Heat a broiler to its highest setting. Heat a large skillet over medium and add
    the oil and butter, swirling to cover the bottom. Pour the tamari into a small,
    shallow dish. Press the tofu one last time. Quickly dip both sides of a single
    slice in the tamari and place it in the skillet. (Be careful as the liquid may
    lead to hot pops from the oil.) Repeat with the remaining tofu slices and tamari.

    Cook until the tofu gets the same beautiful golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3
    minutes per side. While the tofu browns, spread half of the barbecue sauce on
    a small rimmed baking sheet. Transfer the tofu to the barbecue sauce on the sheet,
    then cover with the remaining sauce. Broil, turning once, until the sauce thickens
    and bubbles, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve hot.'

  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt
  - 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan
  - 2 pounds yellow or Vidalia onions, peeled, halved and thinly sliced
  - 5 sprigs fresh thyme, plus more thyme leaves for garnish
  - 1 fresh or dried bay leaf (optional)
  - Black pepper
  - 1 pound cavatappi or elbow pasta
  - 1 baguette, cut into 1/2-inch slices
  - 1 garlic clove
  - 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, red wine vinegar or white wine vinegar
  - 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
  - 4 cups whole milk
  - "16 ounces Gruy\xE8re, grated (about 5 cups)"
  - 12 ounces white Cheddar, grated (about 4 cups)
  Instructions: "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. (If you\u2019re planning\

    \ twice, until the onions are softened, 3 to 5 minutes.\nUncover and continue\
    \ to cook on medium-high, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown, 20 to\
    \ 25 minutes. If the onions look dry, add a few tablespoons of water at a time\
    \ to prevent them from burning, scraping up any browned bits that are stuck to\
    \ the bottom of the skillet. (You will need to do this several times.)\nWhile\
    \ the onions are cooking, heat the oven to 450 degrees. Cook the pasta in the\
    \ boiling water until 2 minutes shy of al dente; drain and set aside. Rub one\
    \ side of each baguette slice with garlic.\nWhen the onions are a deep golden\
    \ brown, discard the thyme sprigs and bay leaf and deglaze the skillet with the\
    \ vinegar until evaporated, scraping up browned bits as you go, about 30 seconds.\
    \ Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. When melted, add the flour and cook,\
    \ stirring, until the flour begins to stick to the bottom of the pan and has turned\
    \ a light golden brown, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in the milk and season with\

  Ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 pounds cultivated brown mushrooms, like shiitake, cremini or portobello
  - 1/2 pound pale wild mushrooms, like chanterelle (or use King trumpet or oyster)
  - Extra virgin olive oil
  - 1 large onion, diced
  - Salt and pepper
  - 1 teaspoon chopped thyme
  - 1 teaspoon chopped sage or rosemary
  - Pinch red pepper flakes or cayenne
  - 1 tablespoon tomato paste
  - 3 small ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
  - 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
  - Porcini broth, heated, or use chicken or vegetable broth
  - 1 tablespoon butter
  - 3 garlic cloves, minced
  - 3 tablespoons chopped parsley
  Instructions: "Clean mushrooms, keeping colors separate, and trim tough stems. (Save\
    \ stems for stock.) Slice mushrooms about 1/8-inch thick.\nIn a wide skillet,\
    \ warm 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium high heat. Add onion, season with salt\
    \ and pepper and cook, stirring, until onion has softened and browned, about 10\
    \ minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.\nAdd 1 more tablespoon oil and turn\
    \ heat to high. Add brown mushrooms, season lightly and stir-fry until nicely\
    \ colored, about 3 minutes. Lower heat to medium. Add thyme, sage, red pepper\
    \ and tomato paste. Add tomatoes, stir well, and cook for 1 minute. Season again\

Fruit Sandwich:

  Ingredients:
  - 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons/200 grams mascarpone
  - 1 tablespoon honey
  - 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/200 grams heavy cream, chilled
  - 4 slices shokupan (milk bread) or any fluffy white sandwich bread
  - 8 to 10 pieces cut fruit (1-inch chunks), such as strawberries, banana, mango
    and kiwi
  Instructions: "Chill a mixing bowl and the beater attachments of a hand mixer in\
    \ the refrigerator for 15 minutes. (A metal bowl will chill more quickly than\
    \ glass.) Meanwhile, in a separate large bowl, mix the mascarpone with the honey\
    \ until smooth.\nPlace the chilled mixing bowl in another, larger bowl filled\
    \ with ice water, to keep it cold. Pour the chilled heavy cream in the mixing\
    \ bowl. (The colder everything is, the less time it will take to whip the cream\
    \ and the lighter and fluffier it will be.) Using a hand mixer with the chilled\
    \ beater attachments, beat the cream until stiff enough to hold peaks, 5 to 8\
    \ minutes on medium.\nAdd the whipped cream to the mascarpone and gently combine.\
    \ The mixture should be fairly firm, so it won\u2019t squeeze out the sides of\
    \ the sandwich when slicing. (If the mixture is too soft, chill briefly until\
    \ firmer but still spreadable, about 5 minutes.)\nTake the 4 slices of bread and\
    \ cut off the crusts on all 4 sides. Using a spatula, spread about 1/3 cup of\
    \ cream filling on each slice of bread. (It will be thick.)\nPat the fruit dry\
    \ with paper towels to absorb any excess moisture. Arrange the fruit on top of\
    \ the cream on 2 slices of bread, keeping in mind that you will be cutting along\
    \ the diagonal and showing off cut sections of fruit. Make a mental note of which\
    \ diagonal you will be using.\nCover the fruit with the remaining cream. Then\
    \ put the other slice of bread, cream side down, on top of the fruit to make the\
    \ sandwich.\nWrap the sandwich with plastic wrap, very tightly, making sure there\u2019\
    s no air inside. Mark your chosen diagonal on the plastic wrap, so you will know\
    \ where to cut. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight.\n\
    Hold a serrated bread knife under hot running water for 15 seconds, then wipe\
    \ dry. (A warm knife cuts more cleanly than a cold one.) Unwrap the sandwich and\
    \ cut along your chosen diagonal line. Serve immediately."

  - 5 garlic cloves, minced or crushed
  - 4 large tomatoes, roughly chopped
  - 1 teaspoon fine sea salt or to taste
  - 4 teaspoons ground cumin
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
  - 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon

  Ingredients:
  - 2 to 3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or vegetable
  - 1 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/2-inch slices
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
  - 10 ounces green beans, trimmed
  - 1/2 small napa cabbage, finely sliced
  - 6 ounces bean sprouts (about 2 cups)
  - 10 new potatoes or other small variety, peeled and halved
  - 1 large cucumber, peeled and sliced thinly on the diagonal
  - 2 tomatoes, each cut into 8 wedges
  - 4 boiled (8-minute) eggs, peeled and halved
  - 1/2 cup homemade or store-bought fried shallots
  - 1 cup roasted unsalted peanuts
  - 4 shallots, peeled and sliced
  - 3 garlic cloves, sliced
  - 1 to 2 red chiles, deseeded and sliced
  - 3 tablespoons kecap manis (see Tip)
  - 2 tablespoons palm or brown sugar
  - 1 teaspoon sea salt
  Instructions: 'Heat a large frying pan over medium-high. When hot, drizzle with
    1 to 2 tablespoons oil and add the tofu slices. Season the tofu well with salt
    and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until
    golden brown. Remove from the pan and allow to cool. Cut tofu into squares or
    triangles.

    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add green beans and blanch for about
    4 minutes or until just tender. Just before the beans are ready, add cabbage and
    bean sprouts to the pot and shock them in the water for about 30 seconds to 1
    minute. Transfer the vegetables to a colander, refresh under cold water and drain
    well.

    Bring the same pot of water (add more water and salt, if required) to the boil,
    and add the potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.

    Meanwhile, make the satay sauce: Place the peanuts, sliced shallots, garlic and
    chile into a blender or food processor, and blitz until it becomes a chunky paste.
    You can add a splash of water to get the blender going, or if you prefer a smoother
    paste. (It is traditional to use a mortar and pestle to make the paste, so if
    you have one, use it.)

    Heat a medium saucepan over medium-low, drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil,
    and add the paste, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes, until fragrant. Add
    the kecap manis, palm sugar, salt and 1 cup water. Stir for 2 to 3 minutes, until
    the sauce is well combined. (Peanut sauce can be stored in a jar in the refrigerator
    for 7 days.)

    To serve, divide the blanched vegetables, potatoes, tofu, cucumber, tomatoes and
    eggs over several serving plates or assemble it all on one large serving platter.
    Drizzle each plate generously with the peanut sauce and top with crispy fried
    shallots.'

    to a plate.

    Carefully add 1/2 cup water, the sugar and star anise to the pan. (The mixture
    will sputter and steam.) Cook, stirring, until the syrup is reduced and turns
    deep amber, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in the stock carefully (again being mindful of
    sputtering), Shaoxing, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and chile and cook, stirring
    frequently, until reduced, syrupy and glossy, 5 to 7 minutes.

  Ingredients:
  - 2 cups vegetable stock
  - 1 cup quick-cooking grits
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
  - 1/2 cup whole milk
  - 1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar (3 ounces)
  - Salt
  - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 shallot, minced
  - 2 garlic cloves, sliced
  - Pinch of red-pepper flakes
  - "1 bunch collard greens (12 \xBD ounces), stems removed, leaves cut into 1-inch\
    \ pieces"
  - 1 bunch Swiss chard (10 ounces), leaves and stems cut into 1-inch pieces
  - Salt and black pepper
  - 1 cup vegetable stock
  - 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
  - Hot sauce, to serve
  Instructions: 'Make the grits: In a medium saucepan, heat the vegetable stock and
    2 cups water over medium-high until boiling. Once boiling, slowly pour in the
    grits while whisking to reduce lumps. Once the grits come to a boil, reduce the
    heat to maintain a simmer and cook, whisking frequently, until thickened, 5 to
    8 minutes.

    Remove the pan from the stove. Season the grits with the pepper, then stir in
    the milk and cheese until the cheese melts. Season to taste with salt. Set aside
    and cover to keep warm.

    Meanwhile, make the greens: Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed
    pot over medium-high. Add the shallot and garlic, and cook, stirring often, until
    softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the red-pepper flakes, collards and chard. Toss
    to combine until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt, add the vegetable stock
    and bring to a simmer.

    Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the
    greens are very tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, and season again
    to taste with salt and pepper. Divide the grits among plates and top with the
    greens and a dash of hot sauce.'

Gyeran Bap (Egg Rice):
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/12/magazine/12mag-Eat-web/12mag-Eat-web-articleLarge-v2.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter
  - 2 large eggs
  - 1 teaspoon soy sauce
  - 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
  - 1 cup steamed white rice, preferably short- or medium-grain
  - 1 (5-gram) packet roasted, salted seaweed, such as gim (optional)
  Instructions: "Melt the butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Continue\
    \ cooking, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula, until the melted butter\
    \ starts to darken in color from yellow to light brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.\n\
    Crack in the eggs and drizzle the soy sauce and sesame oil on top, cooking until\
    \ the whites puff up slightly around the edges of the pan and the translucent\
    \ parts around the yolks start to turn opaque, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Watch that\
    \ the soy sauce doesn\u2019t burn, removing the pan from the heat if necessary.\n\
    Scoop the rice into a medium bowl and top with the fried eggs, including all of\
    \ the buttery soy sauce drippings from the pan. Crush the seaweed directly over\
    \ the eggs, piling it high. This will seem like a lot of seaweed, but it will\
    \ wilt as you mix everything together with a spoon, which you should do to disperse\
    \ the ingredients before eating."

  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/31/dining/31JERUSALEM3/31JPJERUSALEM3-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1 1/4 cups dried chickpeas (250 grams)
  - 1 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons light tahini paste (270 grams)
  - 4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
  - 4 cloves garlic, crushed
  - Salt
  - 6 1/2 tablespoons ice-cold water (100 milliliters)
  Instructions: 'Put chickpeas in a large bowl and cover with cold water at least
    twice their volume. Leave to soak overnight.

    The next day, drain chickpeas. In a medium saucepan, combine drained chickpeas
    and baking soda over high heat. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly.
    Add 6 1/2 cups water and bring to a boil. Cook at a simmer, skimming off any foam
    and any skins that float to the surface, from 20 and 40 minutes, depending on
    the type and freshness. Once done, they should be very tender, breaking easily
    when pressed between your thumb and finger, almost but not quite mushy.

    Drain chickpeas. You should have roughly 3 cups (600 grams) now. Place chickpeas
    in a food processor and process until you get a stiff paste. Then, with the machine
    still running, add tahini paste, lemon juice, garlic and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.
    Slowly drizzle in ice water and allow it to mix for about 5 minutes, until you
    get a very smooth and creamy paste.

    Transfer hummus to a bowl, cover surface with plastic wrap, and let it rest for
    at least 30 minutes. If not using immediately, refrigerate until needed, up to
    two days. Remove from fridge at least 30 minutes before serving.'

Kale Sauce Pasta:

  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
  - 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
  - 2 garlic cloves, smashed flat and peeled
  - 1 pound lacinato kale, thick ribs removed
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - 1/2 pound pasta, like pappardelle or rigatoni
  - 3/4 cup coarsely grated Parmigiano- Reggiano
  Instructions: "Put a large pot of generously salted water over high heat, and bring\
    \ to a boil. In a small skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and garlic, and\
    \ cook until the garlic begins to sizzle. Reduce heat to low, and cook very gently\
    \ until garlic is soft and begins to turn light gold, about 5 minutes. Remove\
    \ from heat.\nWhen water is boiling, add kale leaves, and cook until tender, but\
    \ not mushy, about 5 minutes. Pull out the hot, dripping kale leaves with tongs,\
    \ and put directly into a blender. (Don\u2019t drain the pot; you\u2019ll use\
    \ that same boiling water to cook the pasta.) Add garlic and its oil to the blender,\
    \ along with a splash of hot water from the pot if you need some more liquid to\
    \ get the blender going. Blend into a fine, thick green pur\xE9e. Taste, and adjust\
    \ seasoning with salt and pepper, then blend again.\nAdd the pasta to the still-boiling\
    \ water, and cook according to directions on the package. Ladle out about a cup\
    \ of the water to save for finishing the dish, then drain the pasta and return\
    \ it to the dry pot. Add the kale pur\xE9e, about 3/4 of the grated cheese and\
    \ a splash of the reserved pasta water. Toss until all the pasta is well coated\
    \ and bright green, adding another splash of pasta water if needed so that the\
    \ sauce is loose and almost creamy in texture. Serve in bowls right away, and\
    \ top with an extra drizzle of olive oil and the rest of the grated cheese."

  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/dining/dg-khachapuri/dg-khachapuri-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose or bread flour
  - 3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar
  - 3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
  - 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 12 ounces store-bought pizza dough, or homemade pizza dough completed through
    Step 2
  - 1 cup/100 grams shredded whole milk, low-moisture mozzarella (not fresh mozzarella)
  - 1/3 cup/40 grams goat cheese, finely crumbled
  - 1/3 cup/40 grams drained, finely crumbled brined feta (not low-fat or light)
  - 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted, plus 2 tablespoons cold butter for serving
    (optional)
  - 1 egg yolk from 1 large egg (optional)
  Instructions: "Make the dough (but if you're using store-bought, proceed to Step\
    \ 2): In a small saucepan over low, heat 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/150 milliliters\
    \ water until hot but not simmering. Turn off heat. In a large bowl, with your\
    \ hands or a wooden spoon, stir together flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Check the\
    \ temperature of reserved, warmed water; it should be warm to the touch, between\
    \ 105 and 110 degrees. Add it to the flour mixture and, with your hands, knead\
    \ mixture into a smooth dough, about 5 minutes.\nPour olive oil into a medium\
    \ bowl. Holding dough with one hand, use it to coat the inside of the bowl with\
    \ the oil. Set the dough in the bowl, oiled portion facing up. Cover bowl with\
    \ a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until it doubled in\
    \ volume, about 2 hours.\nHeat oven to 450 degrees (or 425, if using a convection\
    \ oven). Line a half sheet tray with parchment paper; set aside. On a lightly\
    \ floured surface, stretch and roll dough into a circle, 1/4-inch thick, 10 to\
    \ 12 inches across. Brush off excess flour, then lay the dough on the sheet tray.\
    \ Using your fingers, roll, press and pinch two opposite sides of the circle a\
    \ few inches into the center, building sides up, then press and pinch the narrow\
    \ ends together to form two points. Continue to pinch and press the sides to create\
    \ a raised rim and form the dough into an oval boat with an eye-like shape. Let\
    \ rest in a warm place while you prepare the filling.\nIn a medium bowl, combine\
    \ mozzarella, goat cheese and feta with 3 tablespoons water. Stir with a fork\
    \ until the mixture is thoroughly blended. Scrape the cheese mixture into the\
    \ center of the dough boat, spreading it into an even layer.\nBake khachapuri\
    \ until the crust begins to brown and the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.\
    \ Remove pan from oven, leaving oven on. Brush sides of khachapuri generously\
    \ with melted butter. Return khachapuri to the oven for an additional 5 minutes\
    \ until the crust is extra crisp and the cheese just starts to brown around the\
    \ edges.\nUsing a spoon, make a shallow, 2-inch-wide well in the center of the\
    \ cheese. Add the egg yolk and cold butter (if using), and serve immediately.\
    \ To serve, hold down one pointed end of the hot khachapuri with a fork; using\
    \ another fork, quickly stir the egg and butter (if using) into the cheese mixture\
    \ until it\u2019s smooth and stretchy. Rip pieces of the bread boat off to dip\
    \ in the cheese while it\u2019s still hot."

  - Tamarind paste (see Tips) and granulated sugar, honey or chopped dates, for serving
  Instructions: "Place the raw peanuts and rice in separate bowls, and add enough\
    \ water to cover each by 2 inches. Soak at room temperature for at least 1 hour\
    \ and up to 4 hours.\nDrain the peanuts and transfer to a blender. Pour in 2 cups\

    \ into a medium pot. Return the solids to the blender and combine with another\
    \ 2 cups room-temperature water. Blend on high until pur\xE9ed. Repeat the straining\
    \ process, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. The remaining\
    \ solids should be dry and crumbly. Discard the solids. You should have 4 cups\
    \ of peanut milk in the pot.\nDrain the rice and transfer to the blender (no need\
    \ to wash). Pour in 2 cups room-temperature water and pur\xE9e on high to grind\
    \ the rice until smooth.\nTo the pot of peanut milk, add the selim seed pods,\
    \ ginger, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cayenne and cloves. Heat the milk and spices\
    \ over medium, whisking frequently, until steam begins to rise from the surface,\
    \ about 6 minutes. If using ground spices, continue to the next step. If using\

  Ingredients:
  - 1 cup extra virgin olive oil
  - 2 medium red onions, finely diced
  - 2 large cloves minced garlic
  - 8 ounces pancetta, diced
  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 1/2 cups good red wine, preferably Italian
  - 2 28-ounce cans Italian plum tomatoes
  - 3 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 3/4 pound ground sirloin
  - 1/4 cup freshly grated pecorino Romano
  - 2 eggs
  - 10 sprigs fresh parsley, leaves only, washed and dried
  - 2 large whole cloves garlic
  - 1/2 cup flour
  - 1 pound Italian sausage, a mix of hot and sweet
  - 1 15-ounce container ricotta cheese
  - 2 extra-large eggs
  - 2 cups freshly grated pecorino Romano
  - 1/2 cup chopped parsley
  - 1 pound mozzarella, grated
  - 16 sheets fresh lasagna noodles, preferably Antica Pasteria
  Instructions: 'For the sauce, heat 1/2 cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle
    over low heat. Add the onions, minced garlic and pancetta, and cook, stirring,
    for 10 minutes, until the onions are wilted. Season liberally with salt and pepper.
    Raise heat slightly, add the wine and cook until it is mostly reduced, about 20
    minutes. Crush the tomatoes into the pan, and add their juice. Add the tomato
    paste and 2 cups lukewarm water. Simmer for 1 hour.

    Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl. Chop the parsley with the
    whole garlic until fine, then stir into the beef mixture. Season lavishly with
    salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix until all the ingredients are well blended.
    Shape into meatballs and set aside.

    Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dust the meatballs
    lightly with flour, shaking off excess, and lay into the hot oil. Brown the meatballs
    on all sides (do not cook through) and transfer to the sauce.

    In a clean skillet, brown the sausages over medium-high heat. Transfer to the
    sauce. Simmer 1 1/2 hours.

    Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs, pecorino
    Romano, parsley and all but 1 cup of the mozzarella. Season well with salt and
    pepper. Mix thoroughly.

    Remove the meatballs and sausage from the sauce, and set aside to cool slightly,
    then chop coarsely. Spoon a thick layer of sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-12-inch
    lasagna pan. Cover with a layer of noodles. Spoon more sauce on top, then add
    a third of the meat and a third of the cheese mixture. Repeat for 2 more layers,
    using all the meat and cheese. Top with a layer of noodles, and cover with the

  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/21/multimedia/olive-oil-bars-clark/olive-oil-bars-clark-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1 1/4 cups/155 grams all-purpose flour
  - 1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar
  - "3 tablespoons/25 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"
  - 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
  - 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
  - 10 tablespoons/142 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
  - 4 to 6 lemons
  - 1 1/2 cups/300 grams sugar
  - 2 large eggs plus 3 yolks
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons/5 grams cornstarch
  - Pinch of fine sea salt
  - 4 tablespoons/57 grams butter
  - 1/4 cup/60 milliliters fruity extra-virgin olive oil
  - "Confectioners\u2019 sugar and flaky sea salt, for sprinkling"
  Instructions: "Heat oven to 325 degrees and line a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with enough\
    \ parchment to hang over two of the sides (to be used as handles later to lift\
    \ the bars out of the pan).\nTo make the shortbread base, pulse together the flour,\
    \ granulated sugar, confectioners\u2019 sugar, lemon zest and salt in a food processor,\
    \ or whisk together in a large bowl. Add butter and pulse (or use two knives or\
    \ your fingers) to cut the butter into the flour until a crumbly dough forms.\
    \ Press dough into prepared pan and bake until shortbread is pale golden all over,\
    \ 30 to 35 minutes.\nWhile the shortbread is baking, prepare the lemon curd: Grate\
    \ 1/2 tablespoon zest from lemons and set aside. Squeeze lemons to yield 3/4 cup\
    \ juice.\nIn a small saucepan, whisk together lemon juice, sugar, eggs and yolks,\
    \ cornstarch and fine sea salt over medium heat until boiling and thickened, 2\
    \ to 5 minutes. Make sure mixture comes to a boil and stays there for 30 seconds\
    \ or so; you should see it thicken up before you take it off the heat. But once\
    \ it boils do not cook for longer than 1 minute or you risk the curd thinning\
    \ out again. Remove from heat and strain into a bowl. Whisk in butter, olive oil\
    \ and lemon zest.\nWhen the shortbread is ready, take it out of the oven and carefully\
    \ pour the lemon curd onto the shortbread base; return the pan to the oven. Bake\
    \ until topping is just set, 10 to 15 minutes more. Allow to cool to room temperature,\
    \ then refrigerate until cold before cutting into bars. Sprinkle with confectioners\u2019\
    \ sugar and flaky sea salt right before serving."

Lemon and Garlic Chicken With Cherry Tomatoes:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/22/science/26recipehealth/26recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  - 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced or pureed
  - 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
  - Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
  - 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts (most weight 8 to 10 ounces)
  - 1/4 cup dry white wine
  - "2 heaped cups cherry tomatoes, \u2013 about 3/4 pound"
  - Pinch of sugar
  - 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour or a gluten- free flour such as rice flour or
    corn flour
  - 2 tablespoons grapeseed, sunflower or canola oil
  - 1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley
  - 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan (optional)
  Instructions: "Stir together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary, and salt\
    \ and pepper in a large bowl. Cut each chicken breast into 2 equal pieces (3 if\
    \ they weigh 12 ounces or more) and place in the bowl. Stir together and refrigerate\
    \ 15 to 30 minutes.\nRemove chicken from marinade and pat dry with paper towels\
    \ (discard marinade). Place two sheets of plastic wrap (1 large sheet if you have\
    \ extra-wide wrap) on your work surface, overlapping slightly, to make 1 wide\
    \ sheet, and brush lightly with olive oil. Place a piece of chicken in the middle\
    \ of plastic sheet and brush lightly with oil. Cover the chicken with another\
    \ wide layer of plastic wrap. Working from the center to the outside, pound chicken\
    \ breast with the flat side of a meat tenderizer until about 1/4 inch thick. (Don\u2019\
    t pound too hard or you\u2019ll tear the meat. If that happens it won\u2019t be\
    \ the end of the world, you\u2019ll just have a few pieces to cook.) Repeat with\
    \ the remaining chicken breast pieces.\nSeason the pounded chicken breasts with\
    \ salt and pepper on one side only. Dredge lightly in the flour (you will not\
    \ use all of it) and tap the breasts to remove excess.\nTurn oven on low. Heat\
    \ a wide, heavy skillet over high heat and add oil. When oil is hot, place one\
    \ or two pieces of chicken in the pan \u2013 however many will fit without crowding.\
    \ Cook for 1 1/2 minutes, until bottom is browned in spots. Turn over and brown\
    \ other side, about 1 1/2 minutes. (Do not overcook or chicken will be dry.) Transfer\
    \ to a platter or sheet pan and keep warm in the oven. If there is more than a\
    \ tablespoon of fat in the pan, pour some off into a jar or bowl.\nTurn heat on\
    \ burner down to medium-high. Add wine to pan and stir with a wooden spoon to\
    \ deglaze. Add cherry tomatoes and cook, stirring often or tossing in the pan,\
    \ until they begin to shrivel and burst. Add sugar and salt and pepper to taste\
    \ and continue to cook, tossing the tomatoes in the pan and stirring often, for\
    \ 5 to 10 minutes, until tomatoes have collapsed but are still intact. Top chicken\
    \ breasts with the tomatoes, sprinkle with parsley and with Parmesan if using,\
    \ and serve."

Lemon-Almond Butter Cake:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/15/dining/15COOKING-BUTTERCAKE2/15COOKING-BUTTERCAKE2-articleLarge-v2.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - Grated zest and juice of 2 lemons
  - 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
  - 4 extra-large eggs
  - 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed
  - 9 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
  - 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour
  - 1 cup plus 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar
  - 1 teaspoon baking powder
  - 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 2 extra-large eggs
  - 1/2 cup ground toasted almonds
  - 2 tablespoons toasted sliced almonds
  - About 1/2 cup heavy cream for garnish
  - 1 tablespoon almond liqueur (optional)
  Instructions: 'For the curd, combine zest, juice, sugar and eggs in a heatproof
    bowl, and beat well. Add butter, and place over a saucepan full of simmering water.
    Cook, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until mixture
    thickens into curd, about 5 minutes. Strain into a bowl, and press plastic wrap
    onto surface to keep skin from forming. Refrigerate until cool, at least 1 1/2
    hours.

    Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 9-inch spring-form pan with 1 tablespoon butter,
    and dust with 1 tablespoon flour, shaking out excess.

    With an electric mixer, cream the remaining butter and 1 cup sugar together until
    light and fluffy. Sift together the remaining flour, baking powder and salt, and
    stir in. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs until they start to foam. Do not overbeat
    or the cake will be tough. Add eggs and ground almonds to batter, and mix well.

    Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Drop 8 individual tablespoons lemon curd
    around perimeter of batter, leaving a 1-inch border, and taking care to space
    drops evenly. Drop 3 to 4 tablespoons curd into center of batter. Refrigerate
    remaining curd for another use. Sprinkle cake with toasted almonds and 1 to 2
    tablespoons sugar, depending on taste.

    Bake until cake is toasty brown on top and a toothpick inserted into cake (not
    curd) comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool on rack 10 minutes, then remove
    sides of pan, and cool completely.

    Whip cream with almond liqueur. Present cake at table, and offer whipped cream
    on the side.'

  Ingredients:
  - 2 cups sliced almonds
  - 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 2 to 4 lemons)
  - Kosher salt
  - 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil
  - 4 cloves garlic, crushed with the flat side of a knife, peeled and left whole
  - 10 to 12 ounces washed and dried kale leaves, thick stems removed (weight after
    trimming)
  - 1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmesan (optional)
  Instructions: 'In a toaster oven or skillet, toast almonds until golden brown and
    fragrant. Set aside to cool.

    In a bowl, combine lemon juice and 1 heaping teaspoon salt. Slowly whisk in olive
    oil. Add garlic cloves and set aside to steep.

    Working in batches, cut the kale into thin ribbons: gather a large handful of
    leaves, bunch together tightly, and use the other hand to slice into 1/4-inch-thick
    pieces. This need not be done very precisely or neatly; the idea is to end up
    with a kind of slaw. (Recipe can be made up to this point 1 day ahead. Keep kale
    and dressing refrigerated separately.)

    Place chopped kale in a very large bowl. Sprinkle surface with almonds and then
    with cheese, if using. Remove and discard garlic cloves from dressing. Pour half
    the dressing over the salad and toss. Taste for dressing and salt and add more
    as needed, tossing to coat thoroughly. Serve within 1 hour.'

  - 1 or 2 basil sprigs, plus 2 to 4 tablespoons slivered basil (to taste)
  - Freshly grated Parmesan for topping
  - Toasted bread rubbed with garlic for serving (optional)
  Instructions: 'In a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven, combine lentils, water, onion,
    half the garlic, and bouquet garni. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat.
    Add salt to taste, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer 25 minutes, until lentils
    are cooked through but still have some texture. They should not be mushy. Taste
    and adjust salt. Using tongs, remove onion and bouquet garni.

    Meanwhile, make tomato sauce in a separate pan. Heat oil over medium heat and
    add garlic. When it smells fragrant but before it browns, after about 30 seconds
    of sizzling, add tomatoes and stir together. Add sugar, salt, and basil sprigs
    and turn heat to medium-high so tomatoes come to a brisk simmer. Turn heat down
    to medium and cook, stirring often, until tomatoes have cooked down to thick,
    fragrant sauce, about 20 minutes. Remove basil sprigs.

    If using unpeeled tomatoes and a food mill, put sauce through fine blade of the
    mill. Add tomato sauce to lentils, stir together, cover and simmer gently for
    10 minutes. The mixture should be fairly thick, a stew rather than a soup. Add
    freshly ground pepper, taste and adjust salt. Stir in slivered basil.

    Serve in wide bowls, over optional garlic bruschette. Sprinkle Parmesan over each
    serving if desired.'

  Ingredients:
  - 1 1/4 pounds eggplant (1 large), base and stem trimmed
  - 3 tablespoons soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon black vinegar (such as Chinkiang vinegar)
  - 1 tablespoon chile crisp or chile oil (preferably one that contains Sichuan peppercorns)
  - 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
  - 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
  - 2 scallions, trimmed, white and green parts finely sliced
  - 1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)
  - 3 tablespoons neutral oil such as canola or grapeseed
  - Rice, to serve
  Instructions: "Set up a wide, deep skillet or wok with a steamer insert, bamboo\
    \ steamer or stainless steel trivet (see Tip). Find a heatproof plate that fits\
    \ into your cooking vessel. Add about 1 to 2 inches of water (making sure it won\u2019\
    t touch the bottom of the plate), cover with a lid (or sheet pan or aluminum foil)\
    \ that fully encloses the steamer, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.\n\
    Meanwhile, slice the eggplant into \xBD-inch-thick circles, then slice each disk\
    \ into \xBD-inch strips. Arrange the eggplant pieces on the heatproof plate, stacking\
    \ them but leaving some gaps to allow the steam to reach all sides of the eggplant.\n\
    Carefully place the plate of eggplant into the steamer insert or bamboo steamer,\
    \ or on top of the trivet. Cover and steam for 9 to12 minutes, until the flesh\
    \ is easily pierced with a fork, but still firm enough to hold its shape. Carefully\
    \ transfer the eggplant to a colander set in the sink to cool and drain.\nIn a\
    \ small bowl, combine the soy sauce, black vinegar, chile crisp and granulated\
    \ sugar.\nWhen the eggplant is cool to the touch, transfer it to a shallow serving\
    \ bowl or a rimmed plate. Pile the garlic, scallions and ginger in the center\
    \ of the eggplant; don\u2019t scatter.\nIn a small pan, heat the oil on medium-high\
    \ for 2 to 3 minutes; the oil is hot enough if it bubbles when a wooden chopstick\
    \ or spoon is inserted. Very carefully pour the hot oil over the ginger, garlic\
    \ and scallions; it will sizzle and become very fragrant.\nPour the soy sauce\
    \ mixture over the eggplant. Serve warm, at room temperature or cold, with rice."

  Ingredients:
  - 2 pounds cauliflower (about 1 medium head), florets and stem coarsely chopped
  - 1 medium white or red onion, finely chopped
  - 2 tablespoons neutral oil (such as canola or grapeseed)
  - Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
  - 1/2 cup nutritional yeast
  - 1 (15-ounce) can pinto beans, drained, bean liquid reserved
  - 1/2 to 1 chipotle chile in adobo (depending on heat preference), plus 2 teaspoons
    sauce
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder

  Ingredients:
  - 16 ounces medium or medium-firm tofu (if unavailable, go with firm)
  - 1 rounded teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns
  - 3 tablespoons canola oil
  - 6 ounces ground beef or pork (preferably 80 or 85 percent lean), roughly chopped
    to loosen
  - 2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons doubanjiang (fermented chile bean sauce or paste)
  - 1 tablespoon douchi (fermented black beans, optional)
  - 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
  - 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)
  - 2 teaspoons regular soy sauce
  - 1 rounded teaspoon granulated sugar, plus more if needed
  - Fine sea salt
  - 2 large scallions, trimmed and cut on a sharp bias into thin, 2-inch-long pieces
  - 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch dissolved in 3 tablespoons water
  - Cooked white rice, for serving
  Instructions: "Prepare the tofu: Cut the tofu into 3/4-inch cubes and put into a\

    \ darkened. (A wisp of smoke is normal.) Let cool briefly, then pound with a mortar\
    \ and pestle, or pulse in a spice grinder.\nSet a strainer over a measuring cup,\

  Ingredients:
  - 1 (14- or 16-ounce) package silken tofu
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns
  - 2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola oil
  - 8 ounces ground beef or pork (preferably 80 or 85 percent lean), roughly chopped

  - 2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons doubanjiang (fermented chile bean sauce or paste)
  - 1 tablespoon douchi (fermented black beans, optional)

  - 2 teaspoons regular soy sauce
  - 1 rounded teaspoon granulated sugar, plus more as needed
  - Fine sea salt

  - 1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons water
  - 5 to 6 ounces corn tortilla chips (about 5 cups)
  - 2 medium scallions, trimmed and sliced on the bias into 3/4-inch-long pieces
  - 4 ounces shredded Oaxacan, Monterey Jack or other mild-flavored melty cheese (about
    1 1/3 cups)
  - 1/3 cup sliced or coarsely chopped pitted olives, such as black, green or a combination
    (optional)
  - "2 whole pickled jalape\xF1os, sliced (optional)"
  - 1/3 cup coarsely chopped cilantro (optional)
  Instructions: "Prepare the mapo tofu sauce: If the tofu came as a block in water,\
    \ discard the water. Cut the tofu into large chunks, then use a stand blender\
    \ or immersion blender to whirl the tofu into an ivory smoothie.\nIn a medium\
    \ (3- or 4-quart) pot over medium heat, toast the Sichuan peppercorns for 2 to\
    \ 3 minutes, until super fragrant and slightly darkened. (A wisp of smoke is OK.)\
    \ Let cool briefly, then pound with a mortar and pestle or pulse in a spice grinder.\n\
    Prepare the remaining sauce ingredients and set them near the stove.\nWarm the\

    \ into cooked and crumbly pieces, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 2 1/2 tablespoons doubanjiang,\
    \ the douchi (if using), ginger and red-pepper flakes (if using). Fry about 2\
    \ minutes longer, stirring constantly, until the mixture is a rich reddish brown.\n\
    Reduce the heat to medium-low, then stir in the soy sauce and 1 rounded teaspoon\
    \ sugar. Scrape in the blended tofu. (If there\u2019s much left in the blender\
    \ jar, add 1 tablespoon water and whirl to loosen it.) Stir to combine well, partially\
    \ cover and bring to simmer. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally,\
    \ to develop flavor throughout. Expect orange oil to appear on top.\nTaste the\
    \ sauce and if needed, add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon doubanjiang (for heat),\
    \ or a pinch of salt (for savoriness) or sugar (to tame heat).\nStir in the scallion,\
    \ then add the cornstarch slurry and stir until thickened. Turn off the heat.\
    \ Stir in half the crushed Sichuan peppercorns for a bit of zing. Let sit for\
    \ 5 to 10 minutes to deepen flavor and color before using; a little lingering\
    \ orange oil is normal. This recipe makes about 2 1/2 cups, which is twice the\
    \ amount that you\u2019ll need for this recipe; save the rest for spaghetti, more\
    \ nachos or another use. (You can cool the sauce completely then refrigerate it\
    \ in an airtight container for up to 3 days.)\nPrepare the nachos: Heat a toaster\
    \ oven (or standard oven) to 350 degrees. Line the baking pan of the toaster oven\
    \ (or a small sheet pan) with parchment or aluminum foil, leaving a little overhang\
    \ on two sides so you may later easily transfer the nachos. Arrange half of the\
    \ chips on the pan, laying them flat; some overlap is fine. Use a spoon to strew\
    \ a heaping 1/2 cup mapo tofu sauce onto the chips. Sprinkle with half the scallions,\
    \ half the cheese and half the remaining Sichuan peppercorns. Repeat with the\
    \ remaining chips, a heaping 1/2 cup mapo tofu sauce, the remaining scallions,\
    \ cheese and peppercorns.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes, until the cheese completely\
    \ melts and there is gentle sizzling. Remove from the oven, then lift the parchment\
    \ paper or foil to remove the nachos from the pan, then use a spatula to carefully\
    \ usher the nachos to a platter. Top with any combination of olives, pickled jalape\xF1\

  Ingredients:
  - 1 (14- or 16-ounce) package silken tofu
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns
  - 2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola oil
  - 8 ounces ground beef or pork (preferably 80 or 85 percent lean), roughly chopped
    to loosen
  - 2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons doubanjiang (fermented chile bean sauce or paste)
  - 1 tablespoon douchi (fermented black beans, optional)
  - 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
  - 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)
  - 2 teaspoons regular soy sauce
  - 1 rounded teaspoon granulated sugar, plus more as needed
  - Fine sea salt
  - 1 large scallion, trimmed and sliced on a sharp bias into 2-inch-long pieces
  - 1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons water
  - 1 tablespoon fine sea salt
  - 12 ounces dried spaghetti
  - 1 large scallion, trimmed and cut on a sharp bias into 2-inch-long pieces
  - 2 to 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan
  Instructions: "Prepare the mapo tofu sauce: If the tofu came as a block in water,\
    \ discard the water. Cut the tofu into large chunks, then use a stand blender\
    \ or immersion blender to whirl the tofu into an ivory smoothie.\nIn a medium\
    \ (3- or 4-quart) pot over medium heat, toast the Sichuan peppercorns for 2 to\
    \ 3 minutes, until super fragrant and slightly darkened. (A wisp of smoke is OK.)\
    \ Let cool briefly, then pound with a mortar and pestle or pulse in a spice grinder.\n\
    Prepare the remaining sauce ingredients and set them near the stove.\nWarm the\
    \ oil in the pot over high heat. When shimmering, add the meat. Stir and mash\
    \ into cooked and crumbly pieces, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 2 1/2 tablespoons doubanjiang,\
    \ the douchi (if using), ginger and red-pepper flakes (if using). Fry about 2\
    \ minutes longer, stirring constantly, until the mixture is a rich reddish brown.\n\
    Reduce the heat to medium-low, then stir in the soy sauce and sugar. Scrape in\
    \ the blended tofu. (If there\u2019s much left in the blender jar, add 1 tablespoon\
    \ water and whirl to loosen it.) Stir to combine well, partly cover and bring\
    \ to simmer. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, to develop flavor\
    \ throughout. Expect orange oil to appear on top.\nTaste the sauce and if needed,\
    \ add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon doubanjiang (for heat), or a pinch of salt\
    \ (for savoriness) or sugar (to tame heat).\nStir in the scallions, then add the\
    \ cornstarch slurry and stir until thickened. Turn off the heat. Stir in half\
    \ the crushed Sichuan peppercorns to seed a bit of zing. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes\
    \ to deepen flavor and color before using; a little lingering orange oiliness\
    \ is normal. Makes about 2 1/2 cups. (You can also cool completely then refrigerate\
    \ in an airtight container for up to 3 days.)\nPrepare the spaghetti: Fill a large\
    \ pot about halfway with water and add no more than 1 tablespoon of salt to lightly\
    \ season. Bring to a boil over high heat, then add the spaghetti and boil until\
    \ al dente according to package instructions. Ladle out about 3/4 cup of the pasta\
    \ cooking water, then drain the spaghetti. Briefly rinse to remove some of the\
    \ starch and shake to expel excess water.\nIn the same pot (or a clean large skillet,\
    \ if you wish), warm the tofu sauce and 1/3 cup of the reserved pasta cooking\
    \ water over medium heat. When hot and bubbling, add the spaghetti to the sauce.\
    \ Use tongs to stir and coat the strands. Stir in extra pasta water by the tablespoon\
    \ for a creamier, silkier finish, if desired.\nWhen satisfied, stir in the scallion\
    \ and cook very briefly until just softened. Divide the pasta among plates or\
    \ shallow bowls and serve topped with the cheese and the remaining ground peppercorns."

  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/27/dining/ElCerrito_ThePasta2/ElCerrito_ThePasta2-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  - 3 tablespoons butter plus 1 tablespoon for tossing the pasta
  - 1/2 cup chopped onion
  - 2/3 cup chopped celery
  - 2/3 cup chopped carrot
  - 3/4 pound ground beef chuck (or you can use 1 part pork to 2 parts beef)
  - Salt
  - Black pepper, ground fresh from the mill
  - 1 cup whole milk
  - Whole nutmeg
  - 1 cup dry white wine
  - 1 1/2 cups canned imported Italian plum tomatoes, cut up, with their juice
  - 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds pasta
  - Freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese at the table
  Instructions: 'Put the oil, butter and chopped onion in the pot and turn the heat
    on to medium. Cook and stir the onion until it has become translucent, then add
    the chopped celery and carrot. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring vegetables to
    coat them well.

    Add ground beef, a large pinch of salt and a few grindings of pepper. Crumble
    the meat with a fork, stir well and cook until the beef has lost its raw, red
    color.

    Add milk and let it simmer gently, stirring frequently, until it has bubbled away
    completely. Add a tiny grating -- about 1/8 teaspoon -- of nutmeg, and stir.

    Add the wine, let it simmer until it has evaporated, then add the tomatoes and
    stir thoroughly to coat all ingredients well. When the tomatoes begin to bubble,
    turn the heat down so that the sauce cooks at the laziest of simmers, with just
    an intermittent bubble breaking through to the surface. Cook, uncovered, for 3
    hours or more, stirring from time to time. While the sauce is cooking, you are
    likely to find that it begins to dry out and the fat separates from the meat.
    To keep it from sticking, add 1/2 cup of water whenever necessary. At the end,
    however, no water at all must be left and the fat must separate from the sauce.
    Taste and correct for salt.

    Toss with cooked drained pasta, adding the tablespoon of butter, and serve with
    freshly grated Parmesan on the side.'

  Ingredients:
  - 8 medium tomatillos (about 1 pound), peeled and washed
  - 1 large poblano
  - "\xBD medium yellow onion, quartered"
  - 2 to 3 serrano chiles
  - 2 garlic cloves, peeled
  - 1 cup brown (unhulled) sesame seeds
  - "\xBD cup raw pepitas"
  - "\xBD cup raw almonds"
  - 2 dried bay leaves
  - 2 to 3 cloves

  - Seared mushrooms, tofu steaks, roasted cauliflower and/or Mexican rice, for serving
  Instructions: "Add the tomatillos, poblano, onion, serrano chiles and garlic to\
    \ a large preheated comal or cast-iron skillet set over medium heat. Cook everything\
    \ until lightly charred and soft on all sides, about 20 minutes. The poblano should\

    \ 8 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat a dry small to medium skillet over medium. Once\
    \ warmed, toast the sesame seeds, stirring constantly, until golden and fragrant,\
    \ 4 to 5 minutes. Add the toasted seeds to a large bowl and set aside.\nToast\
    \ the pepitas in the same skillet, stirring constantly, until golden, popped and\

    \ cloves until the leaves lightly brown and the cloves become fragrant, 1 to 2\
    \ minutes. Add to the same bowl with the seeds.\nStem and seed the charred chiles,\
    \ and add them along with the remaining charred ingredients and the toasted ingredients\
    \ to a blender. Add the romaine, cilantro, epazote, hoja santa (if using) and\

  Ingredients:
  - 1 1/3 cups plain whole-milk yogurt
  - 1 tablespoon, plus 1 teaspoon minced or grated garlic (about 4 cloves)
  - 2 teaspoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 pound ground chicken (not 100 percent breast meat)
  - 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
  - 1 large egg, lightly beaten
  - 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, plus more for serving
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for frying
  - 1 teaspoon light brown or granulated sugar
  - 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 3 tablespoons toasted pine nuts (optional)
  Instructions: 'First, make the yogurt sauce: Combine 1 cup of the yogurt, 1 teaspoon
    of the garlic, the lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste in
    a small bowl. Mix well, and chill until ready to use.

    Make the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine the remaining 1/3 cup yogurt, remaining
    1 tablespoon garlic, chicken, panko, egg, parsley, olive oil, sugar, paprika,
    cumin, ginger, cinnamon, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a few generous grinds of black
    pepper. Mix gently but thoroughly, until incorporated. Using an ice cream scoop
    or two spoons, form meatballs about 1 1/2-inches in diameter, then place them
    on a plate or sheet pan until ready to use.

    In a large skillet, heat 1/8-inch olive oil over medium-high heat. When the oil
    is hot, fry the meatballs in batches, flipping occasionally, until browned all
    over and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. (If the meatballs begin browning too
    quickly or the oil begins smoking, lower the heat.) Transfer the cooked meatballs
    to a paper towel-lined plate.

    To serve, spread the yogurt sauce in an even layer on a flat platter. Arrange
    the meatballs on top, and top with a sprinkle of chopped parsley and the pine
    nuts, if using. Serve hot.'

  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/dining/as-mozzarella-en-carrozza/as-mozzarella-en-carrozza-articleLarge-v2.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 3 eggs
  - 1 large garlic clove, minced
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 cup bread crumbs (preferably panko)
  - 8 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed
  - 1 pound low-moisture mozzarella (not fresh mozzarella), chilled and cut into 1/4-inch
    slices
  - Olive oil, for frying
  Instructions: 'In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs, then beat in the garlic, season
    with salt and pepper and beat again to combine. In another shallow bowl, add the
    breadcrumbs, season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.

    Top 4 slices of white bread with a single mozzarella slice apiece, and trim the
    cheese as needed to avoid overhang. Top with the remaining 4 slices of white bread
    and press down gently.

    Dip both sides and all the edges of a sandwich in the egg to coat fully, followed
    by the bread crumbs. Place on a large plate and transfer to the refrigerator to
    firm up while you continue to work, then repeat with the other sandwiches.

    In a large skillet, heat 1/4-inch olive oil over medium heat. See if the oil is
    ready by dropping a few bread crumbs in; they should bubble gently. Working in
    batches as needed, fry each sandwich, turning once with a slotted spatula or a
    fork, until the outsides and edges are golden brown and the cheese has melted,
    1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Season with salt, halve diagonally,

  Ingredients:
  - 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan
  - 1/2 pound mixed fresh mushrooms, such as cremini or shiitake, trimmed and sliced
    1/4-inch thick
  - 8 fresh sage leaves, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish, if desired
  - 2 small shallots, halved and thinly sliced
  - 2 tablespoons cognac (optional)
  - 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
  - Black pepper
  - 3 large leeks, white and pale green parts only, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced
    and well washed
  - 6 large eggs
  - 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
  - 1 1/2 cups whole milk
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne
  - "2 ounces grated Gruy\xE8re (about 1 cup)"
  - 12 ounces brioche (or 4 to 6 large brioche buns), cut into 1/2-inch thick slices
  - 1 ounce finely grated Parmesan (about 1/2 cup)
  Instructions: "Boil 1 cup of water in a small saucepan. Add the dried porcini mushrooms\
    \ and soak until softened, about 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the\
    \ mushrooms to a cutting board and finely chop; set aside. Carefully pour remaining\
    \ mushroom liquid into a large bowl, leaving any grit behind.\nIn a large (12-inch)\
    \ skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter over high. Add fresh\
    \ mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 8 minutes. Lower\
    \ heat to medium. Add sage, shallots and chopped porcini, and cook, stirring,\
    \ until shallot is translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cognac, if using, season to\
    \ taste with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, 1 minute more. Transfer to a\
    \ plate.\nIn the same pan, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add the\
    \ leeks and a big pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until wilted, 5 to 7 minutes.\
    \ Return the mushroom mixture to the pan and stir to combine with the leeks. Remove\
    \ from heat.\nAdd eggs to the large bowl with the mushroom liquid, and whisk to\
    \ blend. Add cream, milk, cayenne, 1\xBD teaspoons salt and plenty of black pepper.\
    \ Whisk thoroughly to combine, then add the Gruy\xE8re.\nGrease the bottom and\
    \ sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with butter, then add about 1/4 of the fresh\
    \ mushroom mixture and arrange in an even layer. Arrange the bread slices on top\
    \ in an overlapping pattern. Sprinkle the remaining mushroom mixture over top,\
    \ tucking it in between the bread slices. Ladle the custard mixture over top,\
    \ evenly distributing the cheese. Refrigerate, covered, overnight (see Tip).\n\
    When ready to cook, remove the dish from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before\
    \ baking. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Top the pudding with Parmesan and bake\
    \ for 40 to 45 minutes until set in the center (it may puff a bit). Run it under\
    \ the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes to brown the top, watching carefully. Let sit\
    \ 10 minutes, then serve warm, topped with additional sage if desired."

Mushroom Omelet With Chives:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/12/14/health/14recipehealth_600/14recipehealth_600-articleLarge-v2.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 shallot, minced
  - 1/4 pound white or cremini mushrooms, rinsed briefly and wiped dry
  - Salt
  - freshly ground pepper to taste
  - 1 to 2 garlic cloves (to taste), minced
  - 2 teaspoons minced flat-leaf parsley
  - 4 eggs
  - 1 tablespoon minced chives
  - 2 teaspoons low-fat milk
  - "3 tablespoons grated Gruy\xE8re cheese"
  Instructions: "Trim off the ends of the mushrooms, and cut into thick slices. Heat\
    \ a large, heavy frying pan over medium-high heat, and add 1 tablespoon of the\
    \ olive oil. Add the shallot, and cook, stirring, until it begins to soften, two\
    \ or three minutes. Add the mushrooms, and cook, stirring or tossing in the pan,\
    \ for a few minutes, until they begin to soften and sweat. Add salt to taste and\
    \ the garlic, and cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms are tender, about\
    \ five minutes. Stir in the parsley, season to taste with salt and pepper, and\
    \ remove from the heat.\nIf making individual omelets: Heat an 8-inch nonstick\
    \ omelet pan over medium-high heat. Break 2 eggs into a bowl, and beat with a\
    \ fork or a whisk until frothy. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste, and\
    \ 2 teaspoons milk. Whisk in half the chives. Add 2 teaspoons of the olive oil\
    \ to the pan. When the pan feels hot as you hold your hand above it, pour in the\
    \ eggs, scraping every last bit into the pan. Tilt the pan to distribute the eggs\
    \ evenly over the surface. Tilt it slightly again, and gently shake with one hand\
    \ while lifting up the edges of the omelet with the spatula in your other hand\
    \ so as to let the eggs run underneath during the first few minutes of cooking.\
    \ Spread half the mushrooms down the middle of the eggs. Top with half the cheese.\
    \ As soon as the eggs are set on the bottom (the top will still be runny), jerk\
    \ the pan quickly away from you then back towards you so that the omelet folds\
    \ over on itself. Shake in the pan for another minute if you don\u2019t like the\
    \ omelet soft on the inside; for a moist omelet, tilt the pan at once and roll\
    \ out onto a plate. Keep warm in a low oven while you repeat with the remaining\
    \ eggs and herbs, and serve.\nIf making 1 large omelet, heat a 10-inch nonstick\
    \ pan over medium-high heat. Beat all 4 eggs in a bowl with the milk, salt and\
    \ pepper, and the chives. Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in the pan,\
    \ and follow the instructions for the 2-egg omelet, pouring all of the eggs into\
    \ the pan. The eggs will take longer to set, and you may want to flip the omelet\
    \ in the pan again after it\u2019s rolled, if the middle seems too runny. Roll\
    \ the finished omelet onto a platter, or cut in half in the pan, and serve.\n\
    Add 2 teaspoons of the olive oil to the pan. When the pan feels hot as you hold\
    \ your hand above it, pour in the eggs, scraping every last bit into the pan.\
    \ Tilt the pan to distribute the eggs evenly over the surface. Tilt it slightly\
    \ again, and gently shake with one hand while lifting up the edges of the omelet\

Mushroom Pasta Stir-Fry:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/25/dining/hm-pasta-stir-fry/hm-pasta-stir-fry-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 pound spaghetti or other long pasta
  - 4 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed
  - 1 pound mushrooms (any small variety), trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
  - 2 garlic cloves, grated
  - 1 1/4 teaspoons five-spice blend
  - 3/4 pound broccolini, trimmed and cut into 3-inch pieces, thick stems halved lengthwise
  - 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 2 scallions, thinly sliced
  - 2 tablespoons oyster sauce (or vegetarian mushroom oyster sauce)
  - 2 tablespoons maple syrup or brown sugar
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon sesame oil
  - 1 tablespoon chile oil or chile crisp
  Instructions: 'Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according
    to package instructions, until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water,
    then drain the pasta.

    Meanwhile, heat a large (12-inch), deep skillet over medium-high. When hot, add
    2 tablespoons oil and the mushrooms. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes, giving it a stir
    every 2 minutes or so. The mushrooms will release lots of liquid, but it will
    evaporate as it cooks. When the mushrooms start to turn golden, add the garlic,
    five spice and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and black pepper, then cook for 1 minute.
    Transfer the mushrooms to a plate and set aside.

    While the mushrooms are cooking, make the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk the oyster
    sauce, maple syrup, soy sauce, sesame oil and chile oil with 1/4 cup water until
    combined. Set aside.

    Heat the same skillet back over medium-high. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil
    and the broccolini. Season with salt and pepper and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, tossing
    occasionally, until the broccolini is tender but still quite crisp.

    Add the pasta to the pan, along with the sauce and the butter. Using tongs, toss
    to combine, then add the reserved pasta cooking water, 1/4 cup at a time, just
    to loosen the sauce. When the butter has melted, add the mushrooms and toss again.
    Remove from the heat. Serve topped with scallions.'

  Ingredients:
  - 1/2 cup dried porcini mushrooms (1/2 ounce)
  - 4 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed
  - 1/2 pound fresh oyster mushrooms, torn into separate pieces (or shiitake mushrooms,
    stemmed and halved)
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, stemmed and quartered (or cut into sixths if large)
  - 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
  - 1/4 pound lacinato kale, stemmed, leaves thinly sliced crosswise
  - 4 garlic cloves, chopped
  - 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
  - 2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
  - 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
  - 1 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
  - 3/4 cup heavy cream
  - 1 cup diced peeled carrots (from 2 medium carrots, cut into 1/2-inch pieces)
  - 1 cup diced peeled parsnips (from 2 medium parsnips, cut into 1/2-inch pieces)
  - 1 cup diced red potatoes (from 2 small potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch pieces)
  - 1 (14- to 16-ounce) package puff pastry, thawed
  - 1 large egg
  Instructions: "Heat oven to 425 degrees. Bring 2 cups of water to boil in a small\
    \ pot. Place the porcini mushrooms in a medium bowl and pour the boiling water\
    \ on top; set aside to soak and soften.\nMeanwhile, in a large (12-inch) ovenproof\
    \ skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Working in two batches so\
    \ the mushrooms brown evenly, add half the oyster mushrooms, season with salt\
    \ and pepper and cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, about 3 minutes.\
    \ Stir the mushrooms, then continue to cook until browned all over, about 3 minutes.\
    \ Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with 2 tablespoons oil and the remaining oyster\
    \ mushrooms; transfer them to the medium bowl. Add another 2 tablespoons oil,\
    \ then add the cremini mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring\
    \ occasionally, until browned and tender, 6 to 8 minutes, lowering the heat as\
    \ needed to avoid burning. Transfer to the bowl.\nReduce the heat to medium and\
    \ add the butter to the skillet. Once the butter is melted, add the onion and\
    \ cook until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the kale, garlic, thyme\
    \ and rosemary, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until\
    \ softened, about 3 minutes, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons oil if the pan seems dry.\
    \ Sprinkle with the flour and cook, stirring, until flour is dispersed and lightly\
    \ toasted, 2 minutes.\nStirring constantly, gradually add the stock, cream and\
    \ 3/4 cup of the liquid from the soaking porcini mushrooms. Cook over medium heat,\
    \ stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, then\
    \ stir in the carrots, parsnips, potatoes, and the saut\xE9ed mushrooms and any\
    \ accumulated juices. Strain the soaked porcini mushrooms, discarding any remaining\
    \ liquid, then roughly chop the mushrooms and stir them into the filling. Season\
    \ to taste with salt and pepper. (If making ahead, the filling can be refrigerated\
    \ a day in advance; just warm it up slightly before assembling and baking.)\n\
    On a lightly dusted work surface using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out\
    \ the puff pastry into a roughly 14-inch circle. Transfer to the top of the skillet,\
    \ allowing slight overhang, folding under and pinching any overhang just below\
    \ the rim of the skillet. In a small bowl, whisk the egg with 1 teaspoon water.\
    \ Lightly brush the egg wash over the top of the puff pastry, then cut 5 (2-inch)\
    \ slits into the puff pastry, starting near the center and radiating outward,\
    \ like the rays of the sun, or create a stripe or crisscross pattern in the puff\
    \ pastry by gently scoring it with a paring knife without fully cutting through.\
    \ Crimp the edges using the tines of a fork, if desired.\nSet the skillet on top\
    \ of an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet and transfer to the middle rack of the\
    \ oven. Bake until the puff pastry is puffed and golden, about 30 minutes. Let\
    \ sit 10 minutes before serving."

  - 3 shallots, finely chopped
  - 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
  - Black pepper
  - 1/3 cup port or marsala wine
  - 1 pound spaghettini or angel hair pasta
  Instructions: 'Add the stock, heavy cream, porcini mushroom powder (if using), 1
    teaspoon fresh thyme leaves and 2 teaspoons salt to a large pot. Bring to a boil

New Mexico Breakfast Burritos:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/15/dining/as-New-Mexico-Breakfast-Burritos/as-New-Mexico-Breakfast-Burritos-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 6 large eggs
  - Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
  - 4 large (about 10-inch) flour tortillas
  - 6 tablespoons neutral oil (such as grapeseed or canola), plus more as needed
  - 15 to 16 ounces frozen shredded hash browns
  - 1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
  - 4 ounces grated Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese (about 1 cup)
  - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 1/2 cup roasted, chopped New Mexico green chiles (see Tip)
  Instructions: "Heat the oven to 300 degrees. In a medium bowl or measuring cup,\
    \ whisk the eggs with 3/4 teaspoon salt; season lightly with pepper. Arrange the\
    \ tortillas on a sheet pan; it\u2019s OK if they\u2019re overlapping or hanging\
    \ off the pan. Set both aside while you cook the potatoes.\nIn a large (12-inch)\
    \ nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Add half the hash\
    \ browns and half the onion. Spread into a thin layer on the bottom and up the\
    \ sides of the skillet. Use a spatula or fork to create a few holes in the hash\
    \ browns to help steam escape for more browning. Season with salt and pepper.\
    \ Cook until browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip in large sections, add another\
    \ tablespoon of oil, spread into a thin layer, and cook until browned on the other\
    \ side, 3 to 5 minutes. If there are areas of the potatoes that are pale on top,\
    \ flip them so they brown. (Taking your time here ensures the potatoes stay crisp.)\
    \ Add more oil if the pan looks dry at any point. Divide the potato mixture between\
    \ 2 tortillas in a line down the center, leaving a 1-inch border.\nRepeat step\
    \ 2 with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil, plus the potatoes and onions, then divide\
    \ them between the 2 remaining tortillas. Sprinkle the cheese over the potatoes\
    \ and tortillas, then transfer to the oven to warm while you cook the eggs.\n\
    In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium-low and swirl to coat. Pour in\
    \ the eggs and cook without touching until the eggs around the edges of the pan\
    \ are set, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, fold and scrape\
    \ across the pan to form big, fluffy curds, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.\n\
    Transfer the tortillas to plates or, for portable and/or make-ahead burritos,\
    \ transfer to individual squares of parchment paper. Spoon the eggs in a line\
    \ next to the potatoes, then add the chiles (about 2 tablespoons per tortilla).\
    \ Working with one tortilla at a time, fold the tortilla\u2019s short sides over\
    \ the filling, then fold the bottom of the tortilla snugly up and over the filling.\
    \ Tightly roll away from you until the entire burrito is secure. If using parchment,\

No-Knead Bread:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/16/dining/mb-no-knead-bread/mb-no-knead-bread-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 3 1/3 cups/430 grams all-purpose or bread flour, plus more for dusting
  - Generous 1/4 teaspoon/1 gram instant yeast
  - 2 teaspoons/8 grams kosher salt
  - Cornmeal or wheat bran, as needed
  Instructions: 'In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 1/2 cups/345
    grams water and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl
    with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm
    room temperature, about 70 degrees.

    Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface
    and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on
    itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.

    Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your
    fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton
    towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side
    down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton
    towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than
    double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.

    At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6-
    to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as
    it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand
    under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess,
    but that is OK. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will
    straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid
    and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on
    a rack.'

Noodle Bowl With Mushrooms, Spinach and Salmon:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/04/science/05recipehealth/05recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 6 cups kombu stock, chicken stock or vegetable stock
  - Soy sauce or salt to taste
  - 6 ounces Japanese soba noodles, cooked and tossed with 2 teaspoons sesame oil
  - 6 fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced (simmer stems in stock for
    20 minutes, remove them and discard), or 6 cremini mushrooms, trimmed and thinly
    sliced
  - 12 to 16 ounces salmon fillet without skin, trimmed of fat and cut into 4 equal
    pieces
  - 1 large bunch spinach, stemmed, washed in 2 changes of water and coarsely chopped
    (about 6 cups) or 1 6-ounce bag baby spinach, rinsed
  - 1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced, light and dark green parts kept separate Cilantro
    leaves and sprigs for garnish
  Instructions: 'Bring the stock to a simmer. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding soy
    sauce or salt if desired. If the noodles have been refrigerated, warm them by
    placing them in a strainer and dipping the strainer into the simmering broth.
    Then distribute the noodles among 4 deep soup bowls.

    Add the sliced mushroom caps, the salmon fillets, the spinach and the white and
    light green parts of the scallions to the simmering stock. Cover and turn off
    the heat. Allow to sit for 5 minutes without removing the cover. The salmon should
    be just cooked through. Leave it a little longer if you want it more opaque.

    Place a piece of salmon on top of the noodles in each bowl. Ladle in the soup,
    taking care to distribute the spinach, mushrooms and scallions evenly. Sprinkle
    on the dark green parts of the scallions, garnish with cilantro and serve.'

  Ingredients:
  - 1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar
  - 1/3 cup/30 grams unsweetened cocoa powder
  - 2 tablespoons cornstarch
  - 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt
  - 2 cups/480 milliliters nondairy milk, preferably oat
  - 3 to 4 ounces/85 to 115 grams bittersweet bar chocolate, finely chopped (see Tip
    1)
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  Instructions: 'In a medium saucepan, use a wooden spoon or silicone spatula to stir
    together the sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt. Slowly stir in the milk and keep
    stirring until smooth and combined.

    Stir the mixture constantly over medium-low heat, scraping the bottom, sides and
    corners of the pan, until the pudding thickens, begins to bubble, and coats the
    back of the spoon or spatula, 5 to 10 minutes. (If the pudding is coating the
    bottom of the pan too quickly, reduce the heat.)

    Add the chocolate and stir vigorously until the pudding is very thick and smooth,
    about 30 seconds longer.

    Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Spoon the pudding into a serving
    bowl or individual cups or ramekins. Serve warm, at room temperature or chilled
    (see Tip 2). It will thicken as it cools.'

  Ingredients:
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 2 sweet or hot Italian sausages (5 to 6 ounces), casings removed
  - 1 (24-ounce) jar passata or (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
  - Kosher salt
  - 1 pound cavatappi, fusilli or other small, tubular pasta
  - 5 packed cups baby spinach (about 5 ounces)
  - 1/2 cup grated Parmesan
  Instructions: "Heat the oil in a 12-inch, deep skillet with a tight-fitting lid\
    \ or a Dutch oven over medium-high until shimmering. Use your hands to pull the\
    \ sausages apart into small pieces; add to the skillet and cook untouched for\

    \ crispy on the outside with no pink remaining. If you have more than 1 tablespoon\
    \ of fat in the pan, drain the excess.\nCarefully pour in the passata (it may\
    \ splatter), then add the cumin, red-pepper flakes and 2 cups water, stirring\
    \ to combine. Season with salt and increase the heat to bring to a boil.\nAdd\
    \ the pasta, coating it with the liquid. (It won\u2019t be fully submerged, and\
    \ that\u2019s OK.) Adjust the heat to maintain an active simmer with small bubbles\
    \ forming on the surface. Cover and let cook, stirring every few minutes to make\
    \ sure nothing is sticking at the bottom of the pan, until the pasta is al dente,\
    \ about 1 minute less than the package instructions. If the pasta is still hard\
    \ at this point, add a few tablespoons of warm water at a time and cook until\
    \ just al dente. Depending on your pasta size and shape, you may need to add several\
    \ tablespoons of water.\nWhen the pasta is just al dente, reduce the heat to low\
    \ and season to taste with salt. Stir in the spinach in batches, and cook, uncovered,\
    \ until most of the spinach is wilted, about 1 minute more. (It will continue\
    \ to wilt in the heat of the pasta after you serve it.) If the pasta seems too\

  - 2 teaspoons rice flour
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil

    and cook, stirring constantly, until the chicken is fully cooked, the green beans
    are crisp-tender and the krapow is glossy, about 2 minutes.

    Remove from heat, add the basil and a dash of white pepper and toss to combine.
    If the sauce seems to cling too tightly to the mixture, add 1 to 2 tablespoons
    of water to make it loose and glossy.

    Thai seasoning to sprinkle on top, according to taste.'

  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt
  - 1 pound rigatoni or penne pasta
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 4 ounces diced pancetta, optional
  - 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
  - 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
  - 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
  - 3/4 cup vodka
  - 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - 3/4 cup heavy cream
  - 1/4 cup grated Grana Padano or Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
  - 1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh oregano
  - 2 tablespoons roughly chopped Italian parsley
  Instructions: 'Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (2 heaping tablespoons
    kosher salt to about 7 quarts water). Add the pasta and cook according to package
    instructions until al dente.

    Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: Heat the oil in a deep 12-inch skillet or pot over
    medium. Add the pancetta, if using, and fry until crispy, stirring occasionally,
    3 to 5 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and red-pepper flakes and cook, stirring
    occasionally, until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Turn the heat to medium-low,
    add the vodka and cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes.

    Stir in the tomatoes and then fill the can halfway with water and swish it around
    to loosen up any leftover tomatoes; add a quarter to half of the water to the
    pan. Simmer until the sauce begins to thicken, about 10 minutes, and season with
    salt and pepper. If you prefer your sauce a little looser, go ahead and add the
    remaining water and simmer 2 to 3 minutes more. Reduce heat to low, add the cream
    and cook, stirring, until the sauce becomes an even pinkish-rust color, about
    1 minute.

    Stir in the cooked pasta and 1/4 cup cheese; toss to coat. Season to taste with
    salt and pepper. Divide among bowls, top with additional cheese, if desired, and
    sprinkle with the oregano and parsley.'

Pasta With Kale Pesto and Roasted Butternut Squash:

  Ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 pounds butternut squash
  - 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, more for drizzling
  - 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more for squash
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 small bunch (about 1/2 pound) lacinato kale, center ribs removed
  - 8 ounces pasta (penne rigate works well)
  - 1/3 cup toasted pine nuts
  - 2 large garlic cloves, roughly chopped
  - Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
  - Freshly squeezed lemon juice, to taste
  - Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving
  Instructions: 'Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Use a vegetable peeler to peel squash,
    then halve it lengthwise and scoop out seeds. Dice squash flesh into 1-inch pieces,
    place on a baking sheet, and toss with olive oil and season generously with salt
    and pepper. Spread pieces into an even layer, making sure there is space between
    them. Roast, stirring squash pieces once or twice, until golden brown and tender,

    Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; have ready a bowl of ice
    water. Drop kale into boiling water and cook for 45 seconds. Use tongs or slotted
    spoon to transfer kale to ice water. Bring water in pot back to a boil, adding
    more if necessary so there is enough to cook pasta.

    Drain kale well, then wrap tightly in a dry kitchen towel and squeeze thoroughly
    to remove any excess moisture. Roughly chop leaves. When water in pot comes back
    to a boil, cook pasta according to package directions.

    In a food processor, pulse together kale, nuts, garlic, salt and lemon zest until
    mixture is smooth and salt has dissolved. With motor running, slowly drizzle in
    the oil until fully incorporated. Taste and add more salt dissolved in a little
    lemon juice, if necessary.

    Drain pasta, reserving a little cooking water. Toss pasta with kale pesto and
    some pasta cooking water if necessary to help it coat pasta. Add cheese, lemon
    juice and salt to taste. Serve topped with squash and more cheese.'

  Ingredients:
  - Salt and pepper
  - 2 garlic cloves, peeled
  - 1 pound fusilli or other short, curly pasta
  - 1/3 cup pumpkin seeds (pepitas), plus more for sprinkling
  - 1 large bunch basil (4 ounces), leaves and tender stems picked (3 cups)
  - "2/3 cup/2\xBD ounces finely grated Parmesan, plus more for sprinkling"
  - 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 1/2 cups grape or cherry tomatoes, halved (optional)
  Instructions: 'Bring a large saucepan of generously salted water to a boil. Drop
    the garlic cloves into the boiling water and boil for 30 seconds to temper their
    sharpness. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cloves to a food processor or blender.

    Drop the pasta into the boiling water and cook until al dente.

    While the pasta cooks, add the pumpkin seeds and a pinch each of salt and pepper
    to the garlic, and process until very finely ground. Scrape the sides of the bowl
    and add the basil. Scoop 1/4 cup water from the saucepan with the boiling pasta
    and pour over the basil. Process the basil until ground to a paste. Add the Parmesan
    and oil, and pulse just until incorporated. Taste the pesto and season with enough
    salt and pepper to make it punchy.

    Drain the pasta and rinse under cool water until room temperature. Shake dry,
    then return to the saucepan, and add the pesto and tomatoes, if using. Stir well
    until everything is evenly coated. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide

Peanut Butter-Miso Cookies:

  Ingredients:
  - 1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour
  - 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
  - 1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature
  - 1 cup/220 grams light brown sugar
  - 1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar
  - 1/3 cup/80 milliliters white miso paste
  - 1/4 cup/60 milliliters chunky peanut butter
  - 1 large egg
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
  - 1/2 cup/105 grams Demerara sugar, plus more as needed
  Instructions: 'In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda and baking powder, and
    whisk until incorporated. Set aside.

    In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix butter,
    light brown sugar and granulated sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy,
    about 5 minutes.

    Add miso and peanut butter to the mixing bowl, and continue to mix at medium speed,
    about 1 minute. Scrape down sides of the bowl to make sure all of the ingredients
    are evenly incorporated, and mix a bit more if needed. Add egg and vanilla extract,
    and mix until just combined.

    Add 1/3 of the flour mixture to the mixing bowl, and mix on low speed until flour
    mixture is incorporated. Repeat with remaining flour mixture in two batches until
    all of it is incorporated.

    Place 1/2 cup Demerara sugar into a small bowl. Working with one piece at a time,
    scoop out about 2 heaping tablespoons of dough (about 50 grams per cookie), and
    roll each portion between your hands until it is nice and round. (If the dough
    is too soft to roll, you can pop the mixing bowl in the refrigerator for 5 to
    10 minutes to firm the dough up slightly.) Drop the piece of dough into the bowl
    of Demerara sugar and turn to coat. Transfer each ball to a parchment-lined baking
    sheet, arranging them about 3 inches apart. Repeat with all of the dough.

    Refrigerate for 2 hours and up to overnight. (Even 15 minutes of refrigerator
    time will help the dough firm up, and the flavors meld. The longer the dough is
    refrigerated, the more mellow the flavors will be.)

    When ready to bake, heat oven to 350 degrees. Bake cookies for about 15 minutes,
    until crisp at the edges and slightly puffed in the middle. They should still
    be a bit underdone in the center. Pull out the baking sheet and hit it against
    a counter. Place back into the oven to finish for about 3 to 4 minutes. When cookies
    are firm at the edges and slightly puffed in the center, pull them out and again
    hit the baking sheet against the counter. The cookies should appear flat and crinkly
    at the center.

    Let the cookies cool on a baking sheet for a few minutes, then transfer to a cooling
    rack. Store fully cooled cookies in an airtight container; they should retain
    their chewy texture for a few days.'

  - 1 small lemon, zested (if your lemon is very large, just zest half of it)
  - 3/4 cup torn fresh basil or parsley leaves and tender stems, plus more for garnish
  - Grated Parmesan, for serving (optional)
  Instructions: 'Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook,

    While the pasta is cooking, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium.
    Add pepperoni and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisped and brown, 3 to 4
    minutes.

    If the pan looks dry, drizzle in a little more oil. Add garlic, fennel seeds,
    red-pepper flakes (if using) and a large pinch of salt, and cook until garlic
    is lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook until it darkens,

    Cut the zested lemon in half and squeeze some juice into the pasta. Stir in herbs
    and taste, adding more lemon juice and salt, if needed. Cut the remaining half
    lemon into wedges and serve it alongside the pasta, which should be garnished
    with more herbs and a drizzle of oil, and sprinkled with Parmesan, if you like.'

  Ingredients:
  - 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan
  - 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 2 cups polenta (not instant)
  - 5 ounces baby spinach (about 5 cups)
  - 2 cups grated Parmesan
  - 1 pound whole-milk ricotta (about 1 2/3 cups), preferably fresh
  - 3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
  - 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil (or use more parsley)
  - 1 large egg
  - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
  - 1/8 teaspoon grated fresh nutmeg
  - 1 (25-ounce) jar good-quality marinara sauce (3 cups)
  - Large pinch of red-pepper flakes, 1 pinch of dried oregano, 1 grated garlic clove
    or a drizzle of good extra-virgin olive oil, or a combination (optional)
  - 1 pound shredded mozzarella (about 4 cups)
  Instructions: "Heat oven to 425 degrees and butter an 13-by-18-inch rimmed baking\
    \ sheet pan. Grease a rubber spatula with butter.\nPrepare the polenta: In a large\
    \ pot, bring 6 cups water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil over high heat. Reduce\
    \ heat to medium, then slowly pour in polenta, whisking constantly. Cook, whisking\
    \ often, until polenta thickens, 8 to 12 minutes. Whisk in 4 tablespoons butter\
    \ until melted. Whisk in spinach until wilted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat\
    \ and mix in 1 cup grated Parmesan.\nScrape polenta onto the prepared baking sheet.\
    \ Using the greased rubber spatula, spread the mixture into a thin, even layer\
    \ to cover the entire pan, all the way to corners. Sprinkle 1/2 cup grated Parmesan\
    \ on top. Bake until polenta is firm and cheese has melted, 12 to 18 minutes.\
    \ Let cool in the pan on a wire rack until completely cooled, about 1 to 1 1/2\
    \ hours, or place in refrigerator until cool to touch, about 40 to 50 minutes.\
    \ (Polenta can be baked the day before and refrigerated until needed.)\nWhen ready\
    \ to bake the lasagna, heat oven to 400 degrees. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking\
    \ dish.\nPrepare the ricotta filling: In a small bowl, mix ricotta, parsley, basil,\
    \ egg, black pepper, nutmeg and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix until well\
    \ combined and set aside.\nTaste the marinara sauce. If it needs some zip, stir\
    \ in any or all of the optional ingredients.\nAssemble the lasagna: Using a knife\
    \ or pizza cutter, cut cooled polenta in half widthwise, creating 2 pieces roughly\
    \ 9 by 13 inches each. Using a large spatula, gently place one half in prepared\
    \ baking dish. (It is important for polenta to be completely cooled and firm;\
    \ otherwise, the pieces may break when transferring to baking dish. If anything\
    \ breaks, just reassemble it in the pan. It won\u2019t make much of a difference\
    \ once it\u2019s covered in sauce and baked.)\nSpread about half the ricotta mixture\
    \ in an even layer on top of polenta. Pour about half of marinara sauce on top\
    \ of ricotta, sprinkle with about half of the shredded mozzarella. Repeat with\
    \ remaining polenta, ricotta, marinara and mozzarella. Once assembled, sprinkle\
    \ the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan on top.\nPlace baking dish on top of a rimmed\
    \ sheet pan in case the lasagna bubbles over. Bake until cheese melts, about 30\
    \ minutes. If you like, you can broil lasagna for 2 minutes after baking until\
    \ cheese starts to bubble and develop brown spots.\nRemove from oven and let lasagna\
    \ stand for about 15 minutes to firm up before serving. Leftovers can be refrigerated\
    \ for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 months."

    batter in pan, and smooth the top. Cook, shaking pan occasionally; adjust heat
    so mixture sizzles but does not burn. Continue until bottom is nicely browned,
    at least 15 minutes.

    To turn, slide cake out onto a large plate, cover with another large plate and
    invert. Add a little more oil to pan if necessary, and slide pancake back in,
    cooked side up. Cook 15 minutes or so longer, until nicely browned. Serve hot
    or warm.'

Ramen With Charred Scallions, Green Beans and Chile Oil:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/23/dining/hm-ramen/hm-ramen-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons red-pepper flakes (see Tip)
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
  - 1/2 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed, vegetable or canola
  - 1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped
  - 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
  - 2 teaspoons toasted white sesame seeds
  - 1 teaspoon sesame oil
  - Kosher salt
  - 4 (3-ounce) packages ramen noodles, seasoning packs discarded
  - 2 bunches scallions (10 to 12 scallions), white and green parts separated and
    cut into 2-inch pieces
  - 2 to 3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed, vegetable or canola
  - 10 ounces green beans, trimmed and halved diagonally
  - 1 (2-inch) piece ginger, peeled and julienned
  - White pepper
  - 1 tablespoon toasted white sesame seeds
  Instructions: 'Prepare the chile oil: Add the red-pepper flakes and salt to a heatproof
    bowl. Place the oil, ginger and garlic in a small saucepan, and heat over medium
    until it bubbles, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and very carefully pour
    the hot oil over the red-pepper flakes. Add the sesame seeds and sesame oil, and
    stir well. Set aside while you make the rest of the dish. (Chile oil can be stored
    in an airtight jar at room temperature for up to a month and indefinitely in the
    refrigerator.)

    Prepare the noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ramen
    and cook according to package instructions, about 3 minutes, until the noodles
    are just tender. Drain, rinse with cold water and drain well again.

    Slice the white parts of your scallions lengthwise, in half or quarters, depending
    on thickness, to make cooking faster.

    Heat a wok or large (12-inch), deep skillet on high. When smoking hot, add 1 tablespoon
    of oil, toss in the green beans and season with salt. Cook, tossing the beans,
    for 2 to 3 minutes, until charred. Remove the beans from the wok, and set aside.

    Heat the same wok or skillet over high, and when smoking, add 1 to 2 tablespoons
    of oil, along with the scallions (white and green parts) and the ginger. Allow
    the scallions and ginger to sizzle for 20 to 30 seconds, to release their aromas,
    then stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, until the scallions have a nice scorch.

    Add the green beans and noodles back to the pan, along with 2 or 3 tablespoons
    of the chile oil (reserve some for serving), and season with salt and pepper.
    Toss well to combine, just until the noodles are heated through. To serve, divide
    the noodles into bowls, top with toasted sesame seeds and more chile oil.'

  - 1 (1-inch) piece ginger, scrubbed and cut into slices
  - 1 red scotch bonnet or habanero chile, cut in half lengthwise
  - 1/2 cup chopped fresh mixed herbs, such as cilantro, dill or parsley, or a combination
  Instructions: 'Heat oven to 425 degrees.

    Spread the mushrooms and thyme sprigs in an even layer on a sheet pan and drizzle
    with 1/4 cup oil. Season with salt and, using your hands, toss to coat. Roast,
    turning the pan halfway through and tossing the mushrooms, until mushrooms are
    golden brown and crisp along the edges, about 25 to 35 minutes.

    Meanwhile, prepare the ata din din: As the mushrooms roast, finely chop half of
    the red onion and transfer it to a small bowl. Add the vinegar, season with a
    pinch of salt and set aside to pickle while you continue cooking. Using a food
    processor, coarsely chop the remaining half onion, the roasted red peppers, garlic
    and ginger. Alternatively, you can chop each ingredient with a sharp knife.

    In a large (12-inch) skillet, heat the remaining 1/4 cup oil over medium. Add
    the red-pepper mixture and chile halves to the skillet and bring up to a simmer.
    Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until any liquid from the vegetables
    evaporates and the relish turns a shade darker, about 8 to 10 minutes. Season
    with salt. Remove the thyme sprigs from the mushrooms and add the mushrooms to
    the red-pepper relish. Stir to combine.

    Remove from heat, discard the chile pieces and add in the chopped herbs. Stir
    to combine. Drain the pickled red onion and top the mushrooms with it. Serve hot,
    alongside some steamed rice or a grain of your choice and fried sweet plantains.'

  Ingredients:
  - 1 cup whole masoor dal, soaked for 10 minutes and drained
  - 1 bay leaf
  - 1/4 cup ghee or neutral oil
  - 1 medium onion, finely chopped
  - 1/2 teaspoon ginger paste or freshly grated ginger
  - 1/2 teaspoon garlic paste or freshly grated garlic
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri red chile powder, or any ground red chile
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 2 medium plum tomatoes, finely chopped
  - 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
  - 3 fresh Thai green chiles, stemmed and chopped
  - 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, from about half a large lemon
  - 1/2 teaspoon garam masala, for garnish
  - 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish
  - Rice or roti, for serving (optional)
  Instructions: 'In a large (about 6-quart) pot, add 7 cups of water, the whole masoor
    dal and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, cover and cook on as high heat as possible
    until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.

    In the meantime, prepare the masala: In a medium-sized (8-inch) frying pan, heat
    ghee over medium heat for 30 to 45 seconds or until melted. Add onion, ginger
    and garlic, and cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions turn
    translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cumin, chile powder, turmeric and coriander.
    Mix well. Stir in tomatoes, add salt and Thai green chiles. Cook on medium heat,
    stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down and the oil separates (it will
    form an outline around the jammy tomato), about 10 minutes.

    Remove 1 cup water from the pot of dal with a ladle (remove more if you want the
    dal to be thicker, or less or none of you prefer it thinner). Stir the masala
    from the frying pan into the pot of dal. Simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, or for 10
    minutes for more tender dal. Turn off the stove, and stir in lemon juice. Sprinkle
    with garam masala and cilantro. Serve with rice, roti or by itself.'

  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 pound linguine fini or other long, thin pasta
  - 4 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling
  - 2 shallots, thinly sliced into rings
  - 1 1/4 pounds Sun Gold, cherry or grape tomatoes
  - 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
  - Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)
  - 1 pound large sea scallops, patted dry
  - 1 1/2 cups roughly chopped mixed herbs, such as tarragon, mint, parsley and chives,
    plus more for serving
  Instructions: 'Bring a large pot of well-salted water (2 heaping tablespoons kosher
    salt to about 7 quarts water) to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package
    instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking water, then drain
    pasta.

    Wipe out the pot and heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium. Add the shallots
    and cook until they begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook,
    stirring occasionally, until they start to burst, 5 to 7 minutes. Add about 1/3
    cup reserved pasta water, and press the tomatoes gently with the back of a spatula
    or wooden spoon to get them nice and jammy. Stir in the garlic and red-pepper
    flakes, if using, and cook, allowing the sauce to simmer, 1 to 2 minutes. Season
    with salt and pepper; set aside.

    Season the scallops well on both sides with salt and pepper. In a 12-inch skillet,
    heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over high. When the oil shimmers, add
    the scallops, working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, and cook until golden
    brown and crisp, flipping once, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

    Add the pasta, 1 1/2 cups herbs and 1/4 cup reserved pasta water to the pot with
    the tomatoes and toss to coat, adding additional pasta water if needed. Divide
    the pasta among shallow bowls and top with scallops. Garnish with additional herbs
    and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired.'

  - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
  - Fine sea salt

Sheet-Pan Chocolate Chip Pancakes:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/14/dining/jg-sheet-pan-pancakes/jg-sheet-pan-pancakes-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus 8 tablespoons/115 grams unsalted
    butter (1 stick), cut into 1/2-inch cubes and chilled
  - 1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters cold buttermilk
  - 1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters cold whole milk
  - 3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour
  - 1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar
  - 1 tablespoon baking powder
  - 1 teaspoon baking soda
  - 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 3/4 cup/125 grams mini chocolate chips
  - Maple syrup, for serving (optional)
  Instructions: 'Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Grease a 13-by-18-inch sheet pan using
    1 tablespoon softened butter, then line it with parchment paper. Set aside.

    In a large measuring cup, combine the buttermilk and milk; set aside.

    In a food processor, add the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt,
    and blend until combined, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle the chilled butter cubes
    on top and pulse the mixture until the butter is coarse and sandy, and some pieces
    are the size of peas. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and pour the buttermilk
    mixture on top. Whisk to combine, then let stand for 5 minutes. Place the prepared
    sheet pan in the oven on the middle rack to heat while the batter sits.

    Remove the hot pan from the oven, add the remaining 2 tablespoons softened butter
    to the pan and return to the oven until the butter is melted and bubbling, about
    1 minute. Remove the pan and carefully tip to spread the melted butter around.
    Working quickly, stir the risen batter one final time and pour it into the center
    of the pan, tipping the pan again to spread the batter evenly. Sprinkle the chocolate
    chips evenly over the batter.

    Return the pan to the oven and bake until cooked through, 13 to 15 minutes. Broil

    chopped thyme leaves. Let rest at room temperature while you prepare peppers.

    Spread peppers on a rimmed sheet pan, and toss with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, 1/2
    teaspoon salt and the black pepper to taste. Top peppers with the remaining thyme
    sprigs. Roast, tossing occasionally, until peppers are softened and golden at
    the edges, 15 to 20 minutes.

    Increase oven temperature to 500 degrees. Push peppers to the edges of the pan,
    clearing a space in the center. Lay fish out on that empty space and drizzle with
    oil. Scatter olives over the top of fish and peppers. Roast until fish turns opaque
    and is just cooked through, 6 to 10 minutes.

    Meanwhile, make a vinaigrette by combining vinegar, garlic and a pinch of salt
    in a bowl. Whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, then whisk in parsley.
    Taste and add more salt or vinegar, or both, if needed. Serve fish and peppers
    drizzled with vinaigrette.'

  Ingredients:
  - 1 (14- to 16-ounce) block extra-firm tofu, drained
  - 2 medium red or yellow onions, or a mix, each cut through the root into 8 wedges
  - 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  - Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
  - 2 tablespoons white sesame seeds (toasted or untoasted)
  - 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
  - 1 1/2 cups parsley or cilantro leaves and tender stems, tough stems thinly sliced
  - 2 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice
  Instructions: "Arrange a rack on the bottom third of the oven and heat the oven\
    \ to 425 degrees. Cut the tofu in half lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise\
    \ into 8 pieces, for a total of 16 domino-size pieces. Pat them dry and set aside.\n\
    On a parchment-lined sheet pan, toss the onions with 1 tablespoon olive oil and\
    \ season with salt and pepper. (It\u2019s OK \u2014 good even \u2014 if the wedges\
    \ come apart; this will result in crisp edges.)\nIn a medium bowl, stir together\
    \ the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil with the sesame seeds, turmeric, 1 teaspoon\
    \ salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Pat the tofu dry once more, then add to the turmeric\
    \ mixture and toss gently to coat. (Tofu can be refrigerated in the marinade up\
    \ to 1 day ahead.)\nNestle the tofu among the onions. Reserve the bowl; no need\
    \ to wash. Roast the tofu and onions on the bottom rack until the onions are soft\
    \ and browned and the tofu is crisp, 35 to 40 minutes.\nLet the tofu cool slightly.\
    \ Meanwhile, in the reserved bowl, add the parsley and lemon juice and toss, scraping\
    \ all the turmeric and sesame seeds from the sides of the bowl. Season to taste\
    \ with salt and pepper, then top the tofu and onions with a pile of the parsley\
    \ salad. Serve warm or at room temperature."

  - 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 1 medium shallot, finely chopped (1/2 cup)
  - 3 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 pound cleaned medium shrimp, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
  - 1 cup thawed frozen peas
  - 2 tablespoons capers, plus 2 tablespoons caper brine
  - 3 tablespoons lemon juice
  - 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, plus more for garnish
  Instructions: 'Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Cook spaghetti

  Ingredients:
  - 8 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 pound peeled and deveined frozen shrimp (16/20-count), thawed and cut into thirds
  - Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
  - 3 large garlic cloves, gently smashed with the flat side of a knife
  - 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
  - 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, or to taste
  - 2 pounds cherry tomatoes, larger ones halved, small ones kept whole
  - 1 pound spaghetti
  - Handful of basil leaves, torn
  - Black pepper
  Instructions: 'In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium. Add the shrimp,
    season with 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until just cooked
    through, about 3 minutes. Transfer the shrimp to a dish and set aside. Discard
    any excess liquid in the pan.

    Add the remaining 6 tablespoons oil and the garlic cloves to the same pan and
    cook over medium-low, turning the garlic a couple of times until light gold and
    fragrant, taking care not to burn them, about 4 minutes. Add the fennel seeds
    and red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Increase
    the heat to medium and add the cherry tomatoes and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.

    Cook the tomatoes, stirring occasionally, until they release their juices and
    get saucy, 25 to 30 minutes. While the tomatoes cook, bring a large pot of well-salted
    water to a boil for the pasta. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, about
    10 minutes.

    Transfer the shrimp with any juices to the tomatoes to reheat for a couple of
    minutes. Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning.

    Set the pasta pot next to the saucepan and use tongs to transfer the spaghetti
    to the tomatoes and shrimp. The starchy water clinging to the spaghetti will make
    for a tasty and silky sauce. (You can drain the spaghetti, if you prefer. If you
    do, reserve 1/4 cup of the pasta water to add as needed for a silky sauce.) Remove
    the pan from the heat, add the basil and toss well. Season with black pepper to
    taste and serve.'

  - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 16 to 20 ounces refrigerated cheese or cheese-and-spinach tortellini or tortelloni

Slow Cooker Creamy Kale With Fontina and Bread Crumbs:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/dining/sg-kale/sg-kale-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - "3 to 3\xBD pounds kale (3 to 5 large bunches), stemmed and leaves roughly chopped\
    \ or torn into bite-size pieces"
  - 3/4 cup olive oil
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning
  - 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, preferably aged
  - 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 1 cup panko-style bread crumbs
  - Black pepper, for seasoning
  - Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
  - 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
  - 8 ounces fontina, grated (about 2 heaping cups)
  Instructions: 'Slow Cooker Method

    Add the kale to a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker in 3 batches: Season each batch with
    about a third of the olive oil, salt and vinegar, and vigorously massage into
    the kale with your hands. This will soften and tenderize the kale, causing it
    to shrink and fit in the slow cooker. Cook the kale until it''s very tender, 3
    to 4 hours on low, stirring once or twice to ensure even cooking. (The greens
    will hold well on warm for up to 2 more hours.)

    Meanwhile, make the bread crumbs: Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-high
    heat. Add the panko, season with a pinch of salt and more generously with pepper,
    and cook, stirring constantly, until the bread crumbs are a deep golden-brown,
    about 3 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest and remove from the heat.

    Using a spoon, break up the cream cheese, and drop the pieces into the slow cooker
    with the kale. (The slow cooker should be on low or warm.) Stir well until the
    cream cheese has melted into the kale. Add the fontina and the lemon juice, stir,
    then cover the slow cooker and let the cheese melt, about 1 minute. Stir to evenly
    combine. Scoop the kale mixture out onto a shallow serving bowl or plate. Evenly
    spoon the bread crumbs on top to serve.

    Stovetop Method

    Add the kale to a large Dutch oven in 3 batches: Season each batch with about
    a third of the olive oil, salt and vinegar, and vigorously massage them into the
    kale with your hands. This will soften and tenderize the kale, causing it to shrink
    and allowing it to easily fit into the pot. Cover the pot and cook on low to medium-low,
    stirring every 10 minutes, until the kale is very tender, about 30 minutes. Adjust
    the heat to low if you feel the kale is browning or sizzling rather than gently
    braising.

    Meanwhile, make the bread crumbs: Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-high
    heat. Add the panko, season with a pinch of salt and more generously with pepper,
    and cook, stirring constantly, until the bread crumbs are a deep golden-brown,
    about 3 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest and remove from the heat.

    Using a spoon, break up the cream cheese, and drop the pieces into the slow cooker
    with the kale, over low heat. Stir until the cream cheese has melted into the
    kale. Add the fontina and the lemon juice, stir, then cover the pot and let the
    cheese melt, about 1 minute. Stir to evenly combine. Scoop the kale mixture out
    onto a shallow serving bowl or plate. Evenly spoon the bread crumbs over the top
    to serve.'

  - 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
  - 1 medium onion, chopped
  - 1 carrot, chopped
  - 1 rib celery, chopped
  - 4 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 2/3 cups white beans (3/4 pound) or dried lima beans, picked over and soaked

  - A bouquet garni consisting of 4 parsley sprigs, 2 thyme sprigs and a bay leaf
  - 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
  - Salt
  - a generous amount of freshly ground pepper
  - 1/2 cup bread crumbs
  Instructions: 'Preheat the oven to 225 degrees. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of
    water to a boil, salt generously and add the kale. Blanch for two minutes, then
    transfer to a bowl of ice water. Drain, squeeze out water and cut into ribbons.
    Set aside. (I blanch the kale to extract some of the bitterness, but you can skip
    this step if you wish).

    Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat in a large ovenproof casserole.
    Add the onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender,
    about five minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds
    to a minute. Add the dissolved tomato paste, and bring to a simmer.

    Add the drained beans, the remaining water, the bouquet garni, herbes de Provence
    and salt and pepper.. Stir in the kale, bring to a simmer, cover and place in
    the oven. Bake three hours until the beans are tender and creamy. Taste and adjust
    salt.

    Mix together the remaining olive oil and the bread crumbs. Sprinkle the bread
    crumbs over the beans, and continue to bake another 30 minutes to an hour until
    the bread crumbs are lightly browned. Remove from the heat and serve; or allow

  - 1 teaspoon soy sauce
  - 1 lime, cut into wedges
  - Kosher salt
  - 1 packed cup cilantro leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped, plus more for
    serving
  - "1/4 cup mashed, ripe Hass avocado (from about \xBD avocado; slice the other half\
    \ for serving) (see Tip)"
  - 2 scallions, light green and white parts only, thinly sliced
  - 3 large garlic cloves, grated or minced
  - 1 (2-inch) piece ginger, grated or minced (about 2 teaspoons)
  - "1/4 to \xBD teaspoon red-pepper flakes, according to taste"

  Instructions: "In a small serving bowl, combine the mayonnaise and soy sauce. Season\
    \ with the juice of 1 lime wedge and salt as needed.\nIn a medium mixing bowl,\
    \ use a fork to mash and thoroughly combine the chopped cilantro, mashed avocado,\
    \ scallions, garlic, ginger, red-pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon\
    \ of the soy-lime mayonnaise. Add the chicken and gently combine. Form into 4\
    \ large balls.\nHeat a large (12-inch) cast-iron or heavy skillet over medium\

    \ crust on the other side, about 3 minutes more. If the patties need more time,\
    \ cover the pan and cook for 1 to 2 more minutes, adjusting the heat as needed\
    \ to avoid scorching.\nSqueeze a lime wedge over the patties and serve sandwiched\
    \ between the buns topped with lettuce, a healthy slathering of the lime-mayonnaise,\
    \ avocado slices, jalape\xF1o slices if using, and cilantro sprigs, if desired.\
    \ Serve with the remaining lime wedges and mayonnaise on the side."

Smashed Cabbage and Mushroom Veggie Burgers:

  Ingredients:
  - 1 large egg
  - 1 cup/115 grams chickpea flour
  - 1 cup water
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 garlic clove, grated
  - 1 medium yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced
  - 1/4 small head green cabbage, core removed and leaves thinly shredded (about 3
    cups/8 ounces)
  - 1/2 pound mixed mushrooms, such as oyster mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms, tough
    stems removed, caps torn into bite-size pieces
  - 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 1/2 cup vegetable oil
  - 6 Cheddar slices
  - 6 brioche buns
  - Mayonnaise, sliced tomatoes, bread and butter pickles, and butter lettuce, for
    serving
  Instructions: 'In a large bowl, whisk together egg, chickpea flour, water, soy sauce
    and garlic. Add onion, cabbage, mushrooms and sesame seeds; season with 1 teaspoon
    each salt and pepper. Using your hands, massage the cabbage mixture to evenly
    coat with the chickpea batter. Cover and let the mixture sit at room temperature
    for 30 minutes. Juices from the vegetables will leach out and make the batter
    slightly wetter.

    Divide the cabbage mixture into 6 portions (about 1 1/2 cups each).

    Heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium-low heat. Cook
    3 portions at a time, coaxing each patty together in the pan and compressing them
    with a flat spatula. Gently fry the patties, without disturbing them, until one
    side is golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until the golden
    brown and the vegetables are cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the patties
    from the pan onto a wire rack. Add remaining 1/4 cup oil to the pan and cook the
    remaining 3 portions.

    Place a slice of cheese on each cooked vegetable patty and allow the residual
    heat from the patties to melt the cheese. Serve sandwiched between buns, topping
    with mayonnaise, tomatoes, pickles and lettuce.'

Smoky Stir-Fried Greens:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/04/dining/04kenji8/04kenji8-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt
  - 12 ounces baby bok choy, choy sum or gai lan (Chinese broccoli), cut into 2-inch
    segments
  - Ice (optional)
  - 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar
  - 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
  - Rice bran, peanut, canola or other neutral, high-temperature frying oil
  - 3 garlic cloves, minced
  Instructions: 'Combine about 2 quarts water and 1 tablespoon kosher salt in a saucepan
    or wok and bring to a boil over high heat. Add vegetables and cook, stirring,
    until bright green and crisp-tender, about 20 seconds. Immediately drain vegetables
    and transfer them to an ice bath, or run under cool water until chilled. Spin
    vegetables dry in a salad spinner, or pat dry on a paper towel-lined sheet tray.

    Combine sugar, cornstarch, white pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons water
    in a small bowl. Stir with a spoon until homogenous, then set aside, leaving the
    spoon in the bowl.

    Using a paper towel, rub a very thin film of oil into a wok or large skillet,
    then set over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon oil and swirl
    to coat. Add garlic and stir-fry until fragrant but not browned, about 10 seconds.

    Immediately add vegetables and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Working quickly, ignite
    your blowtorch and, holding the flame 2 to 3 inches above the vegetables, sweep
    across the surface while shaking the pan, until a smoky aroma reaches your nose,
    about 15 seconds. (You should hear a distinct crackle and see small bursts of
    orange flame as the oil on the vegetables jumps and combusts.)

    Still working quickly, stir-fry for another 30 seconds, and torch for another
    15 seconds. Stir the sauce to loosen and to distribute the cornstarch that has
    settled at the bottom of the bowl, then pour it into the wok and stir-fry until
    the vegetables are coated in a glossy glaze, about 15 seconds. Transfer to a bowl
    and serve immediately.'

  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 pound spaghetti
  - 2 large eggs plus 4 large egg yolks, at room temperature
  - 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (about 1 1/2 ounces), plus more for
    serving
  - 6 ounces thick-cut smoked bacon, cut into 1/4-inch-thick matchsticks
  - 2 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 8 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved
  Instructions: 'Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according
    to package directions until al dente.

    Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine eggs and egg yolks, cheese, 1 teaspoon salt
    and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and whisk well.

    Heat a large skillet over medium. Add bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until
    starting to crisp, about 5 minutes. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons bacon grease
    (reserve any extra for another use). Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until
    sizzling and starting to brown, about 1 minute. Add cherry tomatoes and cook,
    scraping up any browned bits, until softened and juices start to release, about
    2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.

    Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup pasta water. Return pasta to pot (off the heat) and
    add the bacon-tomato mixture. (If necessary, use 2 tablespoons of pasta water
    to stir up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet.)

    While whisking constantly, slowly drizzle 1/2 cup of the hot pasta water into
    the beaten egg mixture until well blended. Slowly drizzle the tempered egg mixture
    into the pasta, tossing the pasta constantly and vigorously, until well incorporated
    and saucy. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle in more pasta water if a thinner
    consistency is desired.

    Serve in bowls with more cheese and black pepper.'

  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 pound elbow macaroni
  - 2 cups whole milk
  - 2 large eggs
  - 4 cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar (about 16 ounces)
  - 1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), melted
  - 2 cups shredded Colby Jack (about 8 ounces)
  Instructions: 'Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bring a large pot of generously salted
    water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook according to package directions until a
    little under al dente, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a colander and rinse under
    cold water to stop cooking. Set aside.

    In a large bowl, whisk milk and eggs. Add cooked macaroni, 2 cups extra-sharp
    Cheddar, melted butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and stir
    until well combined.

    Add half the macaroni mixture to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish in an even layer.

    on top in an even layer. Cover with aluminum foil, transfer to the middle rack
    of the oven and bake for 30 minutes.

    Remove from oven. Carefully remove and discard the aluminum foil. Top the macaroni
    mixture with the remaining 2 cups Cheddar and 1/2 cup Colby Jack. Broil on top
    rack until cheese is browned in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. (The broiled cheese can
    go from golden to burnt fairly quickly, so keep a close eye on it.)

    Remove from oven and let cool until the macaroni and cheese is fully set, 10 to

Spaghetti and Drop Meatballs With Tomato Sauce:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/25/dining/drop-meatballs/drop-meatballs-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - Salt
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 12 ounces ground beef
  - 6 ounces Parmesan, or about 1 1/2 cups
  - 1 bunch fresh parsley
  - 1/4 cup bread crumbs
  - 1 egg
  - Black pepper
  - 1 large onion
  - 3 garlic cloves
  - 6 cups canned crushed tomatoes (a little less than two 28-ounce cans)
  - 3 bay leaves
  - 1 pound spaghetti
  Instructions: "Bring a stockpot of water to a boil and salt it. Put the olive oil\
    \ in a large skillet over medium heat.\nPut the ground beef in a medium bowl.\
    \ Grate the cheese, put 1 cup over the meat and reserve the rest, about 1/2 cup.\
    \ Chop 1/2 cup of parsley and add all but 2 tablespoons to the meat mixture; save\
    \ the rest of the parsley for another use. Add the bread crumbs, crack in the\
    \ egg, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Gently mix until everything is just\
    \ combined.\nRaise the heat to medium-high; use 2 teaspoons to drop rounds of\
    \ the meatball mixture into the skillet without touching one another if you can\
    \ help it. Adjust the heat so the meatballs sizzle but don\u2019t burn and cook\
    \ undisturbed until they\u2019re lightly browned on the bottom, 5 to 6 minutes.\n\
    Meanwhile, trim, peel and chop the onion; scatter it around the meatballs. Peel\
    \ and mince the garlic and put it on top of the onions.\nWhen the meatballs are\
    \ browned on the bottom and the aromatics begin to soften, add the tomatoes to\
    \ the skillet, along with the bay leaves and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Adjust\
    \ the heat so the mixture bubbles gently but steadily, then cover the skillet\
    \ and cook until the meat cooks through, about 8 minutes. Remove the lid and let\
    \ the sauce bubble vigorously to thicken for another 5 to 10 minutes, essentially\
    \ while the pasta cooks. Stir only as needed and carefully if you do.\nAdd the\
    \ pasta to the boiling water and stir. Start tasting after 5 minutes. When the\
    \ pasta is tender but not mushy, drain it, reserving some cooking water. Return\
    \ the pasta to the pot.\nMove the meatballs to one side of the skillet with a\
    \ spatula and stir the sauce; taste and adjust the seasoning. Discard the bay\
    \ leaves and spoon about half the sauce into the pasta pot. Toss the pasta over\
    \ low heat, adding a splash of cooking water to make it saucier if you like.\n\
    To serve, divide the pasta among 4 plates or bowls; top with the meatballs and\
    \ the remaining sauce, and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan and parsley over the\
    \ top."

  Ingredients:
  - 1/2 pound firm tofu
  - 1/4 cup soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
  - 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
  - 1 tablespoon sake
  - 1 tablespoon brown sugar
  - 1 teaspoon grated ginger
  - Pinch of cayenne
  - 8 ounces medium spinach leaves
  - 2 tablespoons lime or lemon juice
  - 2 teaspoons brown sugar
  - 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
  - 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 2 tablespoons white or red miso
  - 1/2 teaspoon grated garlic (from about 2 to 3 cloves)
  - 1 teaspoon grated ginger (from a peeled 1-inch piece)
  - 1 cup chopped cucumber
  - 1 cup thinly sliced daikon radish
  - 1 cup frozen edamame, thawed
  - 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
  - 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds
  - 2 tablespoons roasted peanuts
  - Pinch of kosher salt or flaky sea salt
  Instructions: 'Heat oven to 375 degrees. Slice tofu into 1-inch-by-2-inch pieces
    about 1/4-inch thick and place in a deep bowl or on a platter.

    Make the marinade: In a medium bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar,
    sake, brown sugar, ginger and cayenne. Pour marinade over tofu slices to coat
    well. Leave in marinade for at least 15 minutes. (You may marinate the tofu up
    to 24 hours in advance.)

    While the tofu marinates, pick over spinach leaves and remove any tough stems.
    Swish the spinach in a deep bowl of cold water. Lift leaves from water into a
    colander. If you see any sand in the water, repeat up to 3 times, using fresh
    water each time. Drain well and dry spinach, then wrap in a kitchen towel and
    refrigerate until ready to use. (You may wash the spinach up to 24 hours in advance.)

    Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together lime juice, brown sugar, sesame
    oil, vegetable oil, soy sauce, miso, garlic and ginger.

    Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and arrange the tofu pieces in a single
    layer. Spoon remaining marinade over tofu. Bake, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes,
    until slightly crisped. Remove and leave at room temperature.

    To make the salad, arrange spinach in a low, wide salad bowl or on a deep platter.
    Scatter cucumber, daikon and edamame over spinach, then sprinkle with sesame seeds,
    pumpkin seeds and peanuts. Tuck slices of tofu here and there.

    Sprinkle a pinch of salt over everything, then drizzle salad with dressing and
    serve.'

  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/22/dining/hm-stir-fried-lettuce/hm-stir-fried-lettuce-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - "1 head of iceberg lettuce (about 1\xBD pounds)"
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon sesame oil
  - 2 teaspoons vegetarian stir-fry sauce, or oyster sauce
  - 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar
  - Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
  - Black or white pepper
  - "2 tablespoons plus \xBC cup extra-virgin olive oil"
  - 1 (1-inch) piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped
  - 6 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
  - 4 eggs
  - Steamed rice, for serving
  - 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
  - 2 scallions, green and white parts, finely sliced
  - Maggi seasoning sauce, for serving (optional)
  Instructions: "Using a sharp paring knife, run it around the core of the lettuce,\
    \ then gently pull it out. Remove any discolored outer layers of the lettuce and\
    \ discard. Tear the lettuce into large chunks. Wash the leaves and allow them\
    \ to drain after gently shaking in a colander.\nIn a small bowl, combine the soy\
    \ sauce, sesame oil, vegetarian stir-fry or oyster sauce, sugar and \xBC teaspoon\
    \ salt. Season with pepper.\nHeat a large (12-inch) deep skillet on medium-high.\

    \ and cook for 15 to 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add the lettuce and stir-fry\
    \ for 2 minutes, until it starts to wilt. Pour the sauce over the lettuce and\
    \ stir-fry for another 1 to 2 minutes. (Take care not to overcook, as you want\
    \ your lettuce to retain some crunch.) Taste and season with salt, if needed.\
    \ Place the lettuce (and all the pan juices) in a bowl and set aside. Once your\
    \ skillet is cool enough to handle, rinse it out and dry.\nTo the same skillet\
    \ over medium-high heat, add the \xBC cup olive oil and sliced garlic. Stir constantly\
    \ for 3 to 4 minutes until the garlic turns a pale golden brown. (Watch carefully!\
    \ It burns quickly.) Remove the garlic from the oil with a slotted spoon and place\
    \ on a paper towel to drain; it will continue to brown and crisp as it cools.\n\
    To the remaining oil in the skillet over medium-high heat, add the eggs and cook\
    \ untouched until whites are set, 2 to 3 minutes.\nTo serve, place a mound of\
    \ rice in a bowl, top with lettuce, some pan juices, a fried egg, crispy garlic\

  Ingredients:
  - 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 medium onion, finely chopped
  - Kosher salt
  - 4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
  - 3 tablespoons tomato paste
  - "1 (28-ounce) can tomato pur\xE9e"
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 pound fresh ricotta (about 2 cups)
  - 10 ounces fresh mozzarella, grated (about 2 1/2 cups)
  - 5 1/2 ounces Parmesan, finely grated (about 2 cups)
  - 2 egg yolks
  - 1 garlic clove
  - 12 ounces jumbo shells
  Instructions: "Make the sauce: In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat the olive oil\
    \ over medium. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally,\
    \ until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook, stirring\
    \ frequently, until the paste turns one shade darker, about 2 minutes. Stir in\
    \ the tomato pur\xE9e, season with salt, then bring to a simmer. Cover halfway\
    \ to reduce splattering, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has\
    \ thickened slightly, 20 to 30 minutes.\nHeat the oven to 375 degrees. Bring a\
    \ large pot of salted water to a boil.\nMake the filling: In a medium bowl, combine\
    \ the ricotta with 1 1/2 cups mozzarella, 1 cup Parmesan and the egg yolks. Grate\
    \ the garlic directly into the bowl, then season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2\
    \ teaspoon pepper. Stir to combine, then set aside.\nAdd the shells to the boiling\
    \ water and cook until just shy of al dente. (You\u2019ll want to cook the shells\
    \ about 2 minutes less than the minimum time listed on the package, as the shells\
    \ will continue to cook in the oven in Step 5.) Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, then\
    \ drain the pasta and rinse it under cold water to cool. Count out 24 shells.\
    \ (You will have cooked off more shells than will fit in the dish; that\u2019\
    s insurance in case any rip. Reserve extras for another use.)\nStir the pasta\
    \ water into the sauce, then add half the sauce to a 3-quart/9-by-13-inch baking\
    \ dish and spread it in an even layer. Spoon about 2 tablespoons filling into\
    \ each of the 24 shells, lining up the stuffed shells in the dish as you go. Spoon\
    \ the remaining sauce over the shells, then sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup\
    \ mozzarella and 1 cup Parmesan.\nCover the dish tightly with foil and bake for\
    \ 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake, uncovered, until the cheese is melted\
    \ and the sauce is bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes. (If you\u2019d like to brown the\
    \ cheese, you can broil for a few minutes.) Let sit 5 minutes, then serve."

  Ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 (14-ounce) packages firm tofu, drained
  - 2 tablespoons canola oil
  - 2 tablespoons sesame oil
  - 1 (8-ounce) package all-buckwheat soba noodles
  - 4 garlic cloves, smashed
  - 1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
  - 1 small bunch green onions, white and green parts separated, cut into 2-inch matchsticks
  - 1/3 cup soy sauce or tamari
  - 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar
  - 1 teaspoon black pepper
  - Pinch of red-pepper flakes
  - 4 mini or 1 large, thin-skinned cucumber, thinly sliced

    pot of water to a boil for the soba noodles.

    Cut tofu into 1-inch cubes. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add
    the vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil. When the oil shimmers, add
    the tofu in a single layer, in batches if needed and cook until golden on all
    sides, turning as needed when the tofu releases easily from the pan, about 8 to
    10 minutes total. Lift the tofu out of the pan with a spatula and transfer to

    in cold water until the noodles no longer feel sticky.

    Add garlic, ginger and whites of the onions to the skillet, along with the remaining
    tablespoon sesame oil, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the oil is fragrant,
    stirring constantly, about 1 minute.

  - 1 pound tomatoes
  - 1/2 pound Swiss chard, stemmed, leaves washed in 2 changes of water
  - Salt to taste
  - 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
  - 1 small or 1/2 medium red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
  - 2 large garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 teaspoon lightly toasted cumin seeds, ground
  - 1 teaspoon mild chili powder

  - 1 14-ounce box firm tofu, drained and cut into medium-size cubes
  - 1/4 cup chopped cilantro (more to taste)
  - 8 warm corn tortillas
  - Salsa fresca (optional)
  Instructions: "Preheat broiler with rack set about 4 inches from the heat. Cover\
    \ a baking sheet with foil. Place tomatoes on foil and broil for 6 minutes, until\
    \ blackened in spots or all over. Using tongs, flip over and broil for another\
    \ 4 to 6 minutes. The tomatoes should be charred and cooked through. Remove from\
    \ oven and tip, with juices, into a bowl. Allow to cool until you can handle them,\
    \ then core and discard skins. Pur\xE9e, along with juices in the bowl, in a blender\

    \ and leaves a canal when you run your spoon down the middle, about 5 minutes.\
    \ Season to taste with salt.\nAdd minced chiles and tofu, and mash tofu into the\
    \ tomatoes using the back of your spoon. Add Swiss chard and salt to taste, and\
    \ continue to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring and mashing tofu. Stir in cilantro.\

  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/dining/sd-sweet-pot-coconut-kale/sd-sweet-pot-coconut-kale-articleLarge-v2.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1 3-to-3 1/2-pound butternut squash
  - 2 tablespoons canola oil
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 2 sprigs sage
  - 1 cup thinly sliced leeks
  - 1/2 cup thinly sliced carrots
  - 1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots
  - 1/2 cup thinly sliced onions
  - 6 garlic cloves, smashed
  - 2 tablespoons honey
  - 6 cups vegetable stock, more if needed
  - Bouquet Garni made of 8 sprigs thyme, 2 sprigs Italian parsley, 2 bay leaves and
    1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns, all wrapped in a packet made of 2 green leek leaves
  - "1/4 cup cr\xE8me fra\xEEche"
  - Freshly grated nutmeg
  - 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 1 tablespoon minced chives
  - Extra-virgin olive oil
  Instructions: "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a small baking sheet with aluminum\
    \ foil. Cut the neck off the squash and set it aside. Cut the bulb in half and\
    \ scoop out and discard seeds. Brush each half inside and out with about 1 1/2\
    \ teaspoons of the canola oil. Sprinkle the cavities with salt and pepper and\
    \ tuck a sprig of sage into each. Place cut-side-down on the baking sheet and\
    \ roast until completely tender, about 1 hour. Remove the squash from the oven\
    \ and let cool, then scoop out and reserve the flesh (discard sage).\nMeanwhile,\
    \ using a paring knife, peel away the skin from the neck of the squash until you\
    \ reach the bright orange flesh. Cut the flesh into 1/2-inch pieces (you should\
    \ have about 4 cups).\nPut the remaining canola oil in a stockpot over medium-high\
    \ heat, add the leeks, carrots, shallots and onions and cook, stirring often,\
    \ for about 6 minutes. Add the diced squash, garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and\
    \ 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook gently for 3 minutes, reducing the heat as necessary\
    \ to keep the garlic and squash from coloring. Stir in the honey and cook, stirring,\
    \ for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the stock and bouquet garni, bring to a simmer and cook\
    \ for 10 to 15 minutes or until the squash is tender.\nAdd the roasted squash\
    \ and simmer gently for about 30 minutes for the flavors to blend. Remove from\
    \ the heat and discard the bouquet garni. Transfer the soup to a blender, in batches,\
    \ and pur\xE9e. Strain the soup through a fine sieve into a bowl. Taste the soup\
    \ and adjust the seasoning. Let the soup cool, then refrigerate until ready to\
    \ serve.\nPlace the cr\xE8me fra\xEEche in a small chilled bowl and stir in nutmeg\
    \ to taste. Whisk until the cr\xE8me fra\xEEche holds a shape. Cover and refrigerate.\n\
    Gently reheat the soup until just hot. If it is too thick, add a little more vegetable\
    \ stock. Heat a medium skillet over high heat. When it is very hot, add the butter\
    \ and rotate the skillet over the heat as necessary to brown the butter evenly,\
    \ scraping up any bits that settle in the bottom. As soon as the butter is a hazelnut\
    \ brown, pour it into the pot of soup -- keep a safe distance, it may sputter\
    \ -- then stir.\nLadle the soup into six serving bowls. Top each with a dollop\
    \ of cr\xE8me fra\xEEche. Grind some black pepper over the top and sprinkle on\
    \ the chives. Drizzle a little olive oil over the top."

  Ingredients:
  - 1 (14-ounce) block firm or extra-firm tofu
  - 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce or tamari
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 2 tablespoons canola oil
  - 2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
  Instructions: 'Cut the block of tofu in half horizontally as you would a hamburger
    bun. Pat both pieces dry and wrap in paper towels. If time allows, press the tofu
    by placing a cast-iron skillet or other heavy object on top of the wrapped tofu
    for about 30 minutes. (This helps remove moisture so the tofu retains its shape
    better during cooking.)

    In a measuring cup or bowl, combine the soy sauce, turmeric and cumin with 2 tablespoons
    water.

    Unwrap the tofu and season on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in
    a medium skillet over medium-high. Add the tofu blocks and cook until golden brown
    and crisp on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the tofu and cook until golden brown
    and crisp on the other side, another 3 to 4 minutes. If the tofu is emitting water,
    hold the tofu with a spatula and pour the water out of the pan.

    Lower the heat to medium. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, break up the tofu into
    chunks. Add the scallions and the seasoning mixture and cook, stirring and continuing

Tofu and Tomato Egg Drop Soup:

  Ingredients:
  - 1 tablespoon neutral oil
  - 4 scallions, white and green parts separated, finely sliced
  - 1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped
  - 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
  - 3 cups vegetable stock
  - "1 (14-ounce) package firm tofu, drained, patted dry and cut into \xBD-inch cubes"
  - 2 tablespoons ketchup
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
  - 2 tablespoons granulated or brown sugar
  - 2 teaspoons sesame oil
  - 3 large eggs, well beaten
  Instructions: 'Place a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When hot,
    add neutral oil and heat for 15 seconds. Add the scallion whites and ginger, and
    sizzle for 30 seconds until fragrant.

    Pour in the crushed tomatoes and vegetable stock, and stir to combine. Cover,
    reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 to 6 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

    Add the tofu, ketchup, salt, sugar and sesame oil, and stir to combine. Taste
    and add more sugar and salt if needed. It should be slightly sweet, savory and
    a little tart. Increase heat to medium-high.

    When it comes to the boil, very slowly trickle the beaten eggs into the soup,
    moving in a zigzag or circular motion, distributing it evenly all over the surface
    of the soup. You can leave the egg to set without stirring, and this will give
    you larger chunks of egg. If you like longer strands, run a chopstick or wooden
    spoon slowly through the eggs as they set. The eggs should only take 30 to 60
    seconds to cook. Turn off the heat immediately.

    Ladle soup into bowls and top with the green parts of the scallion. Eat immediately.'

  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt
  - 1 pound wavy or ridged pasta (like cavatappi or rigatoni), or a long noodle (like
    fettuccine)
  - 2 pounds large, ripe tomatoes (about 2 to 3), halved horizontally
  - 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter
  - 1 large garlic clove, peeled
  - 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving
  - Black pepper
  - Torn basil leaves, for serving (optional)
  - Finely grated Parmesan, for serving
  Instructions: 'Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook
    according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking
    water, then drain the pasta.

    Meanwhile, using the large holes of a box grater, grate the cut ends of the tomato
    into a large bowl. Discard or compost skins. Grate the butter into the bowl as
    well. Using the small holes of the box grater, grate the garlic into the bowl.
    Add the red-pepper flakes, and season generously with salt. Refrigerate until
    ready to use.

    Return the drained pasta to the pot, along with the bowl of grated tomato and
    butter. Set over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture
    thickens slightly and glosses the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes (the sauce will thicken
    as it sits). Add pasta water as needed to emulsify the sauce. Season to taste
    with salt and pepper. Serve with more red-pepper flakes, black pepper, basil and

  - 1 yellow onion, chopped
  - 5 garlic cloves, sliced
  - 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
  - Salt and black pepper
  - 2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes
  - 6 ounces Parmesan rind
  - 4 (about 3/4-inch thick) slices of baguette
  - 1 garlic clove, peeled
  - 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan
  Instructions: "In a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat, melt the butter.\
    \ Once it starts bubbling, stir in the onions and saut\xE9 until golden, 5 to\
    \ 7 minutes. Add the garlic, red-pepper flakes, and generous pinches of salt and\

  Ingredients:
  - 1 cup toor dal (split yellow pigeon peas)
  - 2 Roma tomatoes, roughly chopped
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
  - 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 1/4 cup raw whole peanuts
  - 1/4 cup/55 grams ghee
  - 1 sprig fresh curry leaves
  - 3 small pieces Indian cinnamon or 1 cinnamon stick
  - "3 red dried chiles, such as chile de \xE1rbol"
  - 3 cloves
  - 1/4 teaspoon black mustard seeds
  - Pinch of asafoetida
  Instructions: "Prepare the dal: Soak the pigeon peas in a large bowl of warm water\
    \ for about 1 hour. (They will have swelled a little.) Thoroughly rinse the soaked\
    \ pigeon peas with fresh water, then tip the drained pigeon peas into a pot.\n\

  Ingredients:
  - 2 green (unripe) plantains (about 6 ounces each)
  - Neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola oil, for frying
  - Kosher salt, to taste
  Instructions: 'Trim and discard the ends of the plantains. Use a paring knife to
    cut a slit along the length of the plantain to easily remove the peel, carefully
    avoiding cutting into the flesh. If the peel is too firm, use a spoon to lift
    the edges, then discard the peel. Slice the plantain crosswise into 1-inch rounds
    (about 8 pieces per plantain).

    In a large skillet, heat about 1/8-inch vegetable oil over medium. When the oil
    shimmers, add the plantains, flat-side down. Fry until beginning to turn golden,
    about 1 minute per side.

    While keeping the heat on, transfer plantains to a cutting board. Working with
    one piece at a time, use a tostonera or large flat-bottomed cup to gently press
    each plantain to about 1/2-inch thick. (If using a cup, keep it as centered as
    possible to flatten the plantains evenly.)

    Working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan, pan-fry the flattened
    plantains until golden-brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

    Using a slotted spoon, transfer tostones to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

  - 1/2 cup canola or other neutral oil, plus more as needed
  - 8 to 12 garlic cloves, to taste, peeled and ends trimmed
  - Kosher salt
  - 8 cups day-old cooked white jasmine rice
  - 1 to 1 1/2 cups leftover gravy (omit if using ham)
  - 1 1/2 pounds leftover turkey or ham, sliced 1/4-inch thick
  - 4 eggs
  Instructions: "Make the garlic fried rice: Heat a large nonstick pan (preferably\
    \ 10 inches) over a medium-low flame, then add 6 tablespoons of the oil and garlic\
    \ cloves. Season the cloves with a pinch of salt. Cook, turning the cloves occasionally,\
    \ until they are brown and soft, 12 to 14 minutes.\nRemove half the oil and half\
    \ the garlic cloves from the pan and set aside in a small heat-proof bowl. Using\

    \ the pan to an almost rough paste. Before the smashed garlic turns golden, crank\
    \ up the heat, add half the rice and spread to cover the surface of the pan. It\
    \ will pop and sizzle \u2014 that\u2019s good. Let sit for 30 seconds, then toss\
    \ and mix the rice in the pan. Spread the rice out, then let sit again for another\
    \ 30 seconds. Adjust the salt and transfer to a large plate. Lightly cover the\
    \ plate with foil.\nWipe out the pan, add the reserved garlic cloves and their\
    \ oil and repeat with remaining rice.\nIf using turkey and gravy, warm the gravy\
    \ in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until it\u2019\
    s hot.\nMeanwhile, reheat the turkey (or ham): Wipe out the pan, return it to\
    \ medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. When the oil starts to smoke slightly,\
    \ gently lay the meat in pan and sear until golden brown on both sides, about\
    \ 2 minutes per side. (You may need to do this in batches, adding oil as needed.)\
    \ Transfer to a plate and season with salt to taste. Cover with foil and wipe\

    \ Break eggs into pan and cook just until egg whites are fully set but the yolks\
    \ are still runny. Season with salt to taste.\nTo serve, place a few scoops of\

  - 1/3 cup nutritional yeast
  - 1/4 cup cashew butter
  - 2 tablespoons white miso paste
  - 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
  - 16 ounces dried spaghetti
  - 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
  - 1/2 lemon, squeezed as needed (optional)
  Instructions: 'Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high. (Go
    easy on the salt here, since the miso paste added in Step 4 is high in salt.)
    Add the nutritional yeast, cashew butter and miso to a small bowl and stir into
    a thick paste. Crush the peppercorns using the flat side of a knife. (Alternatively,
    you can roughly chop them, or use a pepper grinder set to a coarse setting.)

    Add the pasta to the boiling water, reduce the temperature to medium, and cook,
    stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes before al dente according to package instructions.
    Reserve 2 1/2 cups pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.

    Add 1/4 cup olive oil to the empty pot and heat over medium. Add about two-thirds
    of the crushed black peppercorns and toast, stirring frequently, until fragrant,
    2 to 3 minutes.

    Add the miso mixture, and stir, then whisk in 1 3/4 cups reserved pasta water
    until sauce is smooth. Add the pasta to the sauce and cook over medium-high, tossing
    it constantly and vigorously with tongs, until the sauce is glossy and the pasta
    is fully al dente, 1 to 2 minutes. Add an extra splash of reserved pasta water

  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt
  - 4 ounces raw, unsalted cashews
  - 3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk (or other unsweetened nut milk)
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1/2 large yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
  - 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
  - 3/4 teaspoon onion powder
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
  - 1/4 teaspoon mustard powder
  - Black pepper
  - 1/2 cup nutritional yeast, plus more to taste
  - 5 teaspoons tamari or low-sodium soy sauce
  - 16 ounces elbow macaroni or medium shells
  - 1 cup panko bread crumbs
  - 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing
  - 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  Instructions: "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.\nMeanwhile,\
    \ add the cashews to a large nonstick skillet and heat over medium, stirring frequently,\
    \ until fragrant, toasty and slightly golden, about 4 minutes. Transfer cashews\
    \ to a blender and add the almond milk. Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel.\n\
    Add the oil to the skillet and heat over medium. Add the onion, garlic, onion\
    \ powder, ground turmeric and mustard powder, season with salt and pepper, and\
    \ cook, stirring, until onions are very tender, 8 to 10 minutes, lowering the\
    \ heat as necessary to avoid scorching. Remove from the heat, stir in 1/2 cup\
    \ nutritional yeast and the tamari, then transfer to the blender.\nBlend the cashew\
    \ mixture on high until thick and creamy, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides\
    \ as needed. (This works best with a high-power blender, but any blender will\
    \ work \u2014 just keep blending the mixture 1 to 2 more minutes after the mixture\
    \ looks creamy; it will emulsify further.) You should have about 1 1/2 cups.\n\
    Cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup\
    \ pasta cooking water. Drain pasta, then return cooked pasta to the pot. Stir\
    \ in the cashew cream, then add the pasta cooking water 1/4 cup at a time until\
    \ you achieve desired sauciness. Season to taste with salt, pepper and additional\
    \ nutritional yeast, if desired. Serve immediately. (The sauce thickens significantly\
    \ as it sits. If it starts to coagulate, or if you have any leftover macaroni\
    \ and cheese, stir in a splash of the remaining pasta cooking water to loosen.)\n\
    If you\u2019d like a little crunch on top, prepare the optional panko topping:\
    \ Heat the broiler. In a small bowl, add the panko, olive oil and 2 tablespoons\
    \ nutritional yeast. Pinch the mixture together gently to combine thoroughly;\
    \ season to taste with salt and pepper.\nTransfer the prepared macaroni to a lightly\
    \ oiled 9-by-13-inch baking dish, arrange in an even layer and sprinkle the panko\
    \ mixture on top, if using. Transfer to the oven on the shelf nearest to the broiler\
    \ and broil until just golden on top, about 2 minutes. (The panko toasts quickly,\
    \ so you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on it.) Serve immediately."

  Ingredients:
  - 2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes
  - Kosher salt
  - 1/2 cup olive oil
  - 1 large shallot, peeled, halved, and thinly sliced lengthwise

    a fork yields no resistance, about 15 minutes.

    While the potatoes cook, put the olive oil and shallots in a large skillet, and

    spoon to transfer to the paper towels, and season with salt. Reserve the oil.

    Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water, then drain the potatoes and return them to
    the pot. Mash the potatoes over low heat using a potato masher or wooden spoon
    until completely mashed. Add the reserved potato water 1 tablespoon at a time,
    vigorously stirring until the potatoes are smooth and come together. (You will
    use about 1/2 cup.) Taste, season with salt, then stir in 1/4 cup of the reserved

  Ingredients:
  - 2 broccoli heads, 8 ounces green beans or 2 cups frozen peas, or a combination
  - 1 (14- to 16-ounce) container firm tofu
  - 1 (13.5-ounce) can coconut milk
  - 1 medium onion, chopped
  - Salt and pepper
  - 1 tablespoon curry powder, plus more to taste
  - Cooked rice or other grains or noodles, for serving
  - Hot sauce, for serving (optional)
  Instructions: "If using broccoli, trim the ends of the stems and discard, then cut\
    \ the stems off near the base of the florets. Cut off the thick peel around the\
    \ stems, then cut the stems into 1/2-inch slices. Cut the broccoli crowns into\

    \ and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until\
    \ the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. The coconut milk liquid should have\
    \ evaporated, so the onions should be sizzling in coconut oil and the milk solids\
    \ should be brown and smell toasty. Scrape up any bits sticking to the bottom.\n\
    Turn the heat down to medium-low, add the curry powder and stir until evenly mixed,\
    \ about 10 seconds. Add the remaining coconut milk, stir and bring to a simmer.\
    \ Add the tofu and spread the cubes in an even layer, then top with the broccoli\

  - 2 medium yellow onions, finely chopped
  - 1 red bell pepper or poblano chile, stemmed, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch pieces
  - 4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
  - 1 (15-ounce) can fire-roasted tomatoes, preferably crushed (see Tip)
  - 2 teaspoons chili powder
  - 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce or 1 chipotle chile in adobo, chopped (optional)
  - 1/4 cup sour cream, plus more for serving (optional)
  - 2 (15-ounce) cans black beans, rinsed
  - 5 ounces mild Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese, grated (about 1 1/4 cups)
  - 10 to 12 (6-inch) soft corn or flour tortillas
  - Fresh cilantro leaves and stems, for serving
  Instructions: "Heat the oven to 425 degrees. In a large skillet, heat the oil over\
    \ medium-high. Add the onions, bell pepper and garlic; season with salt and pepper.\
    \ Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and charred in spots, 6 to 8 minutes.\
    \ Stir in the cumin and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.\n\
    Transfer half the vegetable mixture to a blender; add the tomatoes, chili powder\
    \ and hot sauce. Blend until very smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\
    \ (If your blender isn\u2019t particularly strong and the sauce looks more like\
    \ a chunky pur\xE9e, add 1/4 cup sour cream and blend again until smooth.)\nAdd\
    \ the black beans and 1/2 cup cheese to the remaining vegetables in the skillet\
    \ and stir to combine. Some canned beans are already salted, so taste and adjust\
    \ seasonings as needed.\nSpread out the tortillas directly on the oven rack and\
    \ heat until warmed and pliable, 1 to 2 minutes, then wrap in a kitchen towel\
    \ to keep warm. Pour half the enchilada sauce (about 1 1/2 cups) into a medium\
    \ casserole dish or a 9-by-13-inch baking pan and spread it to cover the bottom\
    \ of the dish.\nLine up the filling, tortillas and baking dish in a row. Place\
    \ a little more than 1/4 cup of the bean mixture in the center of one tortilla.\
    \ Roll up the tortilla and place in the casserole dish, seam-side down. Repeat\
    \ with the remaining tortillas.\nPour the remaining sauce over the enchiladas,\
    \ then sprinkle with the remaining 3/4 cup cheese. Bake until the cheese has melted,\
    \ about 10 minutes. Top with sour cream and cilantro and serve immediately."

  Ingredients:
  - Unsalted butter, for greasing the pan
  - 1 pound ricotta (about 2 cups)
  - 1/3 cup finely chopped parsley, plus more for garnish
  - 1/4 cup heavy cream or half-and-half
  - 1 large egg, beaten
  - Pinch of ground nutmeg
  - 3 cups shredded mozzarella (about 12 ounces)
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 pound (dried) lasagna noodles (about 20 sheets)
  - Olive oil, for drizzling
  - 6 cups vegan Bolognese
  - 1 cup finely grated vegetarian Parmesan (optional)
  Instructions: "Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the noodles. Heat oven to\
    \ 375 degrees. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with butter. Set aside.\nWhile\
    \ the water comes to a boil, prepare the ricotta filling: In a large bowl, stir\
    \ together the ricotta, 1/3 cup parsley, cream, beaten egg and nutmeg. Fold in\
    \ 2 cups mozzarella. Season with salt and pepper; set aside.\nOnce the water comes\
    \ to a boil, season it generously with salt, then cook the noodles just until\
    \ slightly softened, about 6 minutes. (The noodles shouldn\u2019t be fully cooked\
    \ so they hold up after baking.) Transfer the cooked noodles to a colander and\
    \ rinse immediately under cold water. Drizzle with oil immediately and toss to\
    \ coat to prevent sticking.\nAssemble the lasagna: Spoon about 1 cup sauce into\
    \ the prepared baking dish and spread into an even layer. Top with one layer of\
    \ lasagna noodles, trimming the noodles as needed. (They can overlap slightly,\
    \ but should be trimmed if the overlap is significant.) Dollop a heaping 3/4 cup\
    \ ricotta mixture on top of the noodles, and spread in an even layer. Pour 1 cup\
    \ sauce on top, and spread in an even layer. Repeat with 3 more layers of noodles,\

    \ sauce. Sprinkle evenly with the remaining mozzarella, then the Parmesan.\nCover\
    \ the lasagna tightly with aluminum foil and bake until warmed through and bubbling,\
    \ about 30 minutes. Remove foil and broil on the top rack until browned in spots,\

  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/08/dining/08COOKING-VEG-SHEPHERDPIE1/08COOKING-VEG-SHEPHERDPIE1-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning
  - 2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and quartered (about 3 large)
  - 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 1/2 cup whole milk
  - 1/2 cup sour cream
  - 1/2 cup packed grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese or vegetarian Parmesan (optional)
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - 3/4 cup French lentils
  - 4 sprigs thyme
  - 3 1/2 cups vegetable broth
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning
  - 4 tablespoons butter
  - 8 ounces sliced mixed mushrooms, such as button, cremini, and shiitake
  - 1 large leek, white part only, thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 cups)
  - 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced (about 1 cup)
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - 2 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 2 tablespoons flour
  - 1 cup frozen peas, thawed
  - 1 to 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
  Instructions: 'In a large pot, bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons salt to
    a boil over high heat. Add potatoes to boiling water and boil for about 15 to
    20 minutes, until soft; a knife should go in with almost no resistance.

    Meanwhile, prepare the filling: In a 10-inch oven-safe skillet with high sides
    or an enameled cast-iron braiser over medium-high heat, bring the lentils, thyme
    and 2 cups of the broth to a simmer with 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce the heat and
    continue to cook the lentils, partly covered, until they are tender and most of
    the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Transfer the lentils to a bowl.

    Finish the topping: In a small saucepan or a microwave oven, heat 6 tablespoons
    of the butter and milk together until butter melts. Drain potatoes well and return
    to pot. Using a masher or a ricer, mash hot potatoes until smooth. Mix in the
    hot butter mixture and sour cream just until blended. Stir in 1/2 of the Parmigiano.
    Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and set aside.

    Finish the filling: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Melt the butter in the 10-inch
    skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often with
    a wooden spoon, until they are deep golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce
    the heat to medium and add leeks, carrots and garlic, and continue to cook until
    tender, another 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the tomato
    paste and stir, cooking until it is well combined, another 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle
    flour over the mixture, stir and cook for 1 minute. Add remaining 1 1/2 cups broth,
    cooked lentils and peas, and cook until thickened. Remove thyme stems and stir
    in lemon juice to taste.

    Top the mixture with dollops of the mashed potatoes, then spread them out over
    the top. (Or transfer the lentil mixture to a 3-quart casserole dish and spread
    into an even layer, and top with potatoes.) Sprinkle with the remaining Parmigiano.
    Transfer to the oven and, if the mixture is at the top edges of your pan, set
    a foil-lined baking sheet underneath the pan to catch any drips. Bake the pie
    until the potatoes have begun to brown and the edges are bubbling, about 30 minutes.
    Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving.'

Warm Tofu and Fresh Soybeans Cooked in Salted French Butter and Celery-Seed Gastrique:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/13/magazine/13eat1/13eat1-articleLarge-v2.png
  Ingredients:
  - 1 pound dried yellow soybeans, any debris removed
  - 9 1/4 cups filtered water
  - 2 teaspoons tofu coagulant (Powdered Nigari or Glucono Delta-Lactone)
  - 1/2 cup sugar
  - 2 tablespoons water
  - 1/2 teaspoon celery seed
  - 1/2 teaspoon crushed chile flakes
  - 1/2 cup apple-cider vinegar
  - 12 tablespoons salted French butter
  - 12 tablespoons water
  - 3 cups frozen fresh shelled soybeans
  - Kosher salt to taste
  - Tofu
  - Gastrique
  - Gray sea salt
  Instructions: "Soak the dried yellow soybeans in tap water overnight at room temperature,\
    \ making sure they are covered by 2 inches of water.\nStrain water from soybeans.\n\
    Pour 3 cups of filtered water into a large heavy-duty blender, then add in the\
    \ strained beans. Grind the mixture until thick and smooth as a milkshake, stirring\
    \ if necessary to encourage the beans to move at first. (You may need to work\
    \ in two batches, depending on the size of your blender.)\nIn a large, clean stainless-steel\
    \ 8-quart pot, bring 6 cups of filtered water to a boil over high heat.\nPour\
    \ soybean pur\xE9e into the boiling water. Stirring gently and constantly with\
    \ a rubber spatula, cook until a rich, slightly thick, silky-looking off-white\
    \ soy milk develops (about 8 minutes), adjusting the temperature as necessary\
    \ so that the milk does not boil over. Be sure to drag the spatula across the\
    \ sides and bottom of the pan as you stir to prevent scorching.\nLine a large\
    \ fine-mesh strainer with 4 layers of cheesecloth, and place the strainer over\
    \ a large bowl. Strain the milk through the cloth and strainer, carefully adding\
    \ it a bit at a time with a ladle if you\u2019re not comfortable pouring the hot\
    \ liquid. As the cheesecloth fills with tofu solids, you may have to empty it\
    \ \u2014 just fold the cheesecloth over the solids, squeeze the cheesecloth until\
    \ you have extracted all the milk and replace the cheesecloth. (Discard soybean\
    \ solids.)\nIn a medium clean stainless pot, heat 6 cups of the soy milk to 165\
    \ degrees, stirring occasionally.\nMeanwhile, dissolve 2 teaspoons of coagulant\
    \ in the remaining 1/4 cup of filtered water. Pour the dissolved coagulant into\
    \ a clean casserole dish, ensuring first that it is large enough to fit all 6\
    \ cups of soy milk.\nPour the hot soy milk over the coagulant, and stir quickly\
    \ and briefly \u2014 only about 3 sturdy and confident Figure 8 strokes with a\
    \ rubber spatula. Let it set up at room temperature undisturbed, 15 to 20 minutes,\
    \ while you prepare the gastrique and fresh soybeans.\nCombine the sugar and water\
    \ in a small stainless saucepot, and cook over high heat until it is a deep-amber\
    \ caramel. Do not stir it.\nWhile the caramel is cooking, add the celery seed\
    \ and crushed chile flakes to the vinegar, and let steep.\nWhen the caramel is\
    \ at desired point of caramelization, carefully add the seasoned vinegar all at\
    \ once. It will stop the sugar from cooking. Take care not to get burned from\
    \ the hissing steam. Let the mixture bubble for a minute or 2, until any bits\
    \ of hard caramel have melted.\nIn a medium saucepot, combine butter, water and\
    \ soybeans over medium-high heat, and simmer until water almost evaporates and\
    \ beans are cooked through and glossy, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with kosher\
    \ salt.\nEvenly divide the beans and their buttery liquid among 6 shallow bowls.\n\
    In one motion, dip into the soft tofu with a large spoon, and slide tofu into\
    \ the center of each bowl.\nDrizzle a spoonful of gastrique onto the beans, leaving\
    \ the tofu pristine. Finish with a few flakes of gray salt on the beans. Serve\
    \ at once."
