  Ingredients:
  - 1 small (7-ounce) can chipotle chiles in adobo (see note)
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 2 carrots, peeled and chopped
  - 2 onions, peeled and chopped
  - 4 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 cup red wine
  - "2 jalape\xF1o peppers, seeded and chopped"
  - 1 pound dry black beans (do not soak)
  - 2 quarts mild vegetable or chicken stock
  - 1 tablespoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 1 tablespoon kosher salt
  - 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
  - Red wine vinegar, to taste
  - 1 small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
  - Freshly squeezed juice of 2 limes
  - Salt
  - Sour cream or Mexican crema
  - Whole cilantro leaves
  - Thinly sliced fresh chiles
  - Sliced avocado
  Instructions: "Empty the can of chiles into a blender or food processor. Pur\xE9\
    e until smooth, scrape into a container, and set aside. Put on a teakettle of\
    \ water to boil, and keep hot.\nIn a large, heavy pot, heat olive oil over medium\
    \ heat until shimmering. Add carrots, onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until\
    \ softened but not browned, 5 to 8 minutes.\nPour in wine and let simmer until\
    \ pan is almost dry and vegetables are coated. Add jalape\xF1os and cook, stirring,\
    \ just until softened, 2 minutes. Push the vegetables out to the edges of the\
    \ pot and dollop 2 teaspoons of chipotle pur\xE9e in the center. Let fry for a\
    \ minute and then stir together with the vegetables.\nAdd beans, stock, oregano\
    \ and bay leaves. Stir, bring to a boil, and let boil 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce\
    \ the heat to a simmer and cook, partly covered, stirring occasionally and adding\
    \ hot water as needed to keep the soup liquid and runny, not sludgy. Continue\
    \ cooking until beans are just softened and fragrant, 1 to 2 hours. Add salt and\
    \ pepper and keep cooking until beans are soft.\nMeanwhile, make the pickled onions,\
    \ if using: In a bowl, combine sliced onions, lime juice and a sprinkling of salt.\
    \ Let soften at room temperature until crunchy and tart, about 30 minutes. Drain\
    \ and rinse with cold water. Squeeze dry in paper towels and refrigerate until\
    \ ready to serve. If desired, chop coarsely before serving.\nAdjust the texture\
    \ of the soup: The goal is to combine whole beans, soft chunks and a velvety broth.\
    \ Some beans release enough starch while cooking to produce a thick broth without\
    \ pur\xE9eing. If soup seems thin, use an immersion blender or blender to pur\xE9\
    e a small amount of the beans until smooth, then stir back in. Continue until\
    \ desired texture is reached, keeping in mind that the soup will continue to thicken\
    \ as it sits.\nHeat the soup through, taste and adjust the seasonings with salt,\
    \ pepper, drops of red wine vinegar and dabs of chipotle pur\xE9e.\nServe in deep\
    \ bowls, garnishing each serving with sour cream, pickled onions, cilantro leaves,\
    \ sliced chiles and avocado as desired."

Brown Butter Skillet Cornbread:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/clark-maple-cornbread-print/clark-maple-cornbread-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks)/170 grams unsalted butter
  - 1/2 cup/120 ml maple syrup
  - 2 1/4 cups/530 ml buttermilk
  - 3 large eggs
  - 1 1/2 cups/180 grams yellow cornmeal, fine or medium-coarse grind
  - 1/2 cup/65 grams whole wheat flour
  - 1/2 cup/60 grams all-purpose flour
  - 1 1/2 tablespoons/18 grams baking powder
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons/9 grams kosher salt
  - 1/2 teaspoon/5 grams baking soda
  Instructions: 'Heat oven to 375 degrees. On the stovetop, in a 11- or 12-inch skillet
    (ovenproof and preferably cast-iron), melt the butter over medium heat. Cook,
    swirling pan to lightly coat sides and bottom, until the foam subsides and the
    butter turns a deep nut brown. (Watch carefully to see that it does not burn.)

    Pour brown butter into a large bowl. (Do not wipe out the pan.) Whisk the maple
    syrup into the butter, then whisk in buttermilk. The mixture should be cool to
    the touch; if not, let cool before whisking in the eggs. Then whisk in the cornmeal,
    flours, baking powder, salt and baking soda.

    If the skillet is no longer hot (cast iron retains heat longer than other metals),
    reheat it briefly on the stove for a few minutes. Scrape batter back into it.
    Bake until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into it emerges clean,
    30 to 40 minutes. Cool in the skillet for 10 minutes before slicing.'

  Ingredients:
  - Salt
  - 1 1/2 cups finely grated pecorino Romano, plus more for dusting completed dish
  - 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  - 1 tablespoon ground black pepper, plus more for finishing the dish
  - 3/4 pound tonnarelli or other long pasta like linguine or spaghetti
  - Good olive oil
  Instructions: 'Put a pot of salted water on to boil. In a large bowl, combine the
    cheeses and black pepper; mash with just enough cold water to make a thick paste.
    Spread the paste evenly in the bowl.

    Once the water is boiling, add the pasta. The second before it is perfectly cooked
    (taste it frequently once it begins to soften), use tongs to quickly transfer
    it to the bowl, reserving a cup or so of the cooking water. Stir vigorously to
    coat the pasta, adding a teaspoon or two of olive oil and a bit of the pasta cooking
    water to thin the sauce if necessary. The sauce should cling to the pasta and
    be creamy but not watery.

    Plate and dust each dish with additional pecorino and pepper. Serve immediately.'

Cast-Iron Steak:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/12/multimedia/recipelab-steak/recipelab-steak-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - Coarse salt, such as kosher salt or Maldon sea salt
  - "1 or 2 boneless beef steaks, 1 inch thick (about 2 pounds total), such as strip,\
    \ rib-eye, flat iron, chuck-eye, hanger or skirt (preferably \u201Coutside\u201D\
    \ skirt)"
  - Black pepper (optional)
  Instructions: "Remove packaging and pat meat dry with paper towels. Line a plate\
    \ with paper towels, place meat on top and set aside to dry further and come to\
    \ cool room temperature (30 to 60 minutes, depending on the weather). Turn occasionally;\

    \ salt. Turn heat to high under pan. Pat both sides of steak dry again.\nWhen\
    \ pan is smoking hot, 5 to 8 minutes, pat steak dry again and place in pan. (If\
    \ using two steaks, cook in two batches.)\nLet steak sizzle for 1 minute, then\
    \ use tongs to flip it over, moving raw side of steak around in pan so both sides\
    \ are salted. Press down gently to ensure even contact between steak and pan.\
    \ Keep cooking over very high heat, flipping steak every 30 seconds. After it\u2019\
    s been turned a few times, sprinkle in two pinches salt. If using pepper, add\
    \ it now.\nWhen steak has contracted in size and developed a dark-brown crust,\
    \ about 4 minutes total, check for doneness. To the touch, meat should feel softly\
    \ springy but not squishy. If using an instant-read thermometer, insert into side\
    \ of steak. For medium-rare meat, 120 to 125 degrees is ideal: Steak will continue\
    \ cooking after being removed from heat.\nRemove steak to a cutting board and\
    \ tent lightly with foil. Let rest 5 minutes.\nServe in pieces or thickly slice\
    \ on the diagonal, cutting away from your body and with the top edge of the knife\

  Ingredients:
  - Salt
  - 1 pound cavatappi or elbow macaroni
  - 1/2 cup unsalted butter
  - 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
  - 6 cups whole milk
  - 1 pound sharp or extra-sharp yellow Cheddar, coarsely grated (5 1/4 cups)
  - 8 ounces Velveeta, torn into pieces
  - 4 ounces Pecorino Romano, coarsely grated (1 cup)
  - 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard powder
  - 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
  - Pinch of ground cayenne
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  Instructions: 'Heat oven to 350 degrees.

    Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season generously with salt. Add the
    pasta and cook according to package instructions, stirring occasionally with a
    wooden spoon, until just past al dente. Drain and set aside.

    Return the empty pot to the stove (no need to clean it) and set over medium heat.
    Melt the butter and simmer, whisking occasionally, until the butter stops spurting
    and quiets down, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the flour and cook, whisking, until smooth
    like gravy, about 1 minute.

    Whisk in the milk. Raise the heat to high and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly,
    then immediately reduce the heat to low and continue simmering until the sauce
    lightly coats the back of a spoon, 2 to 5 minutes. At this stage, the sauce should
    be smooth but relatively loose. Take the pot off the heat.

    To the pot, add the Cheddar, Velveeta, Pecorino Romano, mustard powder, onion
    powder and cayenne, and season generously with salt and black pepper. Whisk until
    the cheese is melted and smooth like nacho cheese. Add the drained pasta, breaking
    up any clumps, and stir until evenly coated in the cheese sauce. Taste and adjust
    seasoning with salt and pepper.

    Transfer to a 9-by-13-inch baking pan or dish and bake until bubbling at the edges,

  Ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
  - 2 (12- to 18-ounce) packages shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi
  - 1/4 cup unsalted butter
  - 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
  - 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 2 pints small tomatoes, such as cherry, grape or Sungold
  - 1/4 cup thinly sliced or torn basil leaves (optional), plus more for serving
  - 8 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut or torn into 1/2-inch pieces
  Instructions: 'Heat the broiler with a rack about 6 inches from the heat source.

    In a large (12-inch) skillet on the stovetop, heat enough olive oil to lightly
    coat the bottom of the pan (about 1 tablespoon) over medium-high. Add half the
    gnocchi to the pan, breaking up any that are stuck together. Cover with a lid
    or baking sheet and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4
    minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi and olive
    oil.

    Add the butter to the skillet and cook over medium-high, stirring often, until
    golden-brown and toasty, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the garlic, red-pepper flakes, 1
    1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper, reducing the heat slightly if necessary
    to avoid scorching. Add the tomatoes and 3 tablespoons water and cook, shaking
    the pan occasionally, until the tomatoes have softened and the liquid has slightly
    thickened, 4 to 6 minutes. Smash the tomatoes as they burst to help them along.

    Add the seared gnocchi and 1/4 cup basil (if using), stir to coat, then shake
    into an even layer. Top with the mozzarella and drizzle lightly with olive oil.
    Broil until the cheese is melted and browned in spots, 2 to 4 minutes. Top with
    more basil, red-pepper flakes and black pepper as desired.'

  Ingredients:
  - 2 cups all-purpose flour
  - 2 teaspoons baking powder
  - 1/4 teaspoon salt
  - 1 tablespoon sugar, optional
  - 2 eggs
  - 1 1/2 to 2 cups milk
  - 2 tablespoons melted and cooled butter (optional), plus unmelted butter for cooking,
    or use neutral oil
  Instructions: 'Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. In a bowl,
    mix together dry ingredients. Beat eggs into 1 1/2 cups milk, then stir in 2 tablespoons
    melted cooled butter, if using it. Gently stir this mixture into dry ingredients,
    mixing only enough to moisten flour; don''t worry about a few lumps. If batter
    seems thick, add a little more milk.

    Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or skillet. When butter foam
    subsides or oil shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle or skillet, making pancakes
    of any size you like. Adjust heat as necessary; usually, first batch will require
    higher heat than subsequent batches. Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface
    and bottoms brown, after 2 to 4 minutes.

    Cook until second side is lightly browned. Serve, or hold on an ovenproof plate
    in a 200-degree oven for up to 15 minutes.'

  Ingredients:
  - 1 1/4 cups dried chickpeas (250 grams)
  - 1 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons light tahini paste (270 grams)
  - 4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
  - 4 cloves garlic, crushed
  - Salt
  - 6 1/2 tablespoons ice-cold water (100 milliliters)
  Instructions: 'Put chickpeas in a large bowl and cover with cold water at least
    twice their volume. Leave to soak overnight.

    The next day, drain chickpeas. In a medium saucepan, combine drained chickpeas
    and baking soda over high heat. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly.
    Add 6 1/2 cups water and bring to a boil. Cook at a simmer, skimming off any foam
    and any skins that float to the surface, from 20 and 40 minutes, depending on
    the type and freshness. Once done, they should be very tender, breaking easily
    when pressed between your thumb and finger, almost but not quite mushy.

    Drain chickpeas. You should have roughly 3 cups (600 grams) now. Place chickpeas
    in a food processor and process until you get a stiff paste. Then, with the machine
    still running, add tahini paste, lemon juice, garlic and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.
    Slowly drizzle in ice water and allow it to mix for about 5 minutes, until you
    get a very smooth and creamy paste.

    Transfer hummus to a bowl, cover surface with plastic wrap, and let it rest for
    at least 30 minutes. If not using immediately, refrigerate until needed, up to
    two days. Remove from fridge at least 30 minutes before serving.'

  Ingredients:
  - 1 cup extra virgin olive oil
  - 2 medium red onions, finely diced
  - 2 large cloves minced garlic
  - 8 ounces pancetta, diced
  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 1/2 cups good red wine, preferably Italian
  - 2 28-ounce cans Italian plum tomatoes
  - 3 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 3/4 pound ground sirloin
  - 1/4 cup freshly grated pecorino Romano
  - 2 eggs
  - 10 sprigs fresh parsley, leaves only, washed and dried
  - 2 large whole cloves garlic
  - 1/2 cup flour
  - 1 pound Italian sausage, a mix of hot and sweet
  - 1 15-ounce container ricotta cheese
  - 2 extra-large eggs
  - 2 cups freshly grated pecorino Romano
  - 1/2 cup chopped parsley
  - 1 pound mozzarella, grated
  - 16 sheets fresh lasagna noodles, preferably Antica Pasteria
  Instructions: 'For the sauce, heat 1/2 cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle
    over low heat. Add the onions, minced garlic and pancetta, and cook, stirring,
    for 10 minutes, until the onions are wilted. Season liberally with salt and pepper.
    Raise heat slightly, add the wine and cook until it is mostly reduced, about 20
    minutes. Crush the tomatoes into the pan, and add their juice. Add the tomato
    paste and 2 cups lukewarm water. Simmer for 1 hour.

    Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl. Chop the parsley with the
    whole garlic until fine, then stir into the beef mixture. Season lavishly with
    salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix until all the ingredients are well blended.
    Shape into meatballs and set aside.

    Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dust the meatballs
    lightly with flour, shaking off excess, and lay into the hot oil. Brown the meatballs
    on all sides (do not cook through) and transfer to the sauce.

    In a clean skillet, brown the sausages over medium-high heat. Transfer to the
    sauce. Simmer 1 1/2 hours.

    Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs, pecorino
    Romano, parsley and all but 1 cup of the mozzarella. Season well with salt and
    pepper. Mix thoroughly.

    Remove the meatballs and sausage from the sauce, and set aside to cool slightly,
    then chop coarsely. Spoon a thick layer of sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-12-inch
    lasagna pan. Cover with a layer of noodles. Spoon more sauce on top, then add
    a third of the meat and a third of the cheese mixture. Repeat for 2 more layers,
    using all the meat and cheese. Top with a layer of noodles, and cover with the
    remaining sauce. Sprinkle reserved mozzarella evenly over the top. Bake 30 minutes.

  Ingredients:
  - 1 1/4 cups/155 grams all-purpose flour
  - 1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar
  - "3 tablespoons/25 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"
  - 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
  - 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
  - 10 tablespoons/142 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
  - 4 to 6 lemons

  - 1 1/2 teaspoons/5 grams cornstarch
  - Pinch of fine sea salt
  - 4 tablespoons/57 grams butter
  - 1/4 cup/60 milliliters fruity extra-virgin olive oil
  - "Confectioners\u2019 sugar and flaky sea salt, for sprinkling"
  Instructions: "Heat oven to 325 degrees and line a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with enough\
    \ parchment to hang over two of the sides (to be used as handles later to lift\
    \ the bars out of the pan).\nTo make the shortbread base, pulse together the flour,\
    \ granulated sugar, confectioners\u2019 sugar, lemon zest and salt in a food processor,\
    \ or whisk together in a large bowl. Add butter and pulse (or use two knives or\
    \ your fingers) to cut the butter into the flour until a crumbly dough forms.\
    \ Press dough into prepared pan and bake until shortbread is pale golden all over,\
    \ 30 to 35 minutes.\nWhile the shortbread is baking, prepare the lemon curd: Grate\
    \ 1/2 tablespoon zest from lemons and set aside. Squeeze lemons to yield 3/4 cup\
    \ juice.\nIn a small saucepan, whisk together lemon juice, sugar, eggs and yolks,\
    \ cornstarch and fine sea salt over medium heat until boiling and thickened, 2\
    \ to 5 minutes. Make sure mixture comes to a boil and stays there for 30 seconds\
    \ or so; you should see it thicken up before you take it off the heat. But once\

Lemon-Almond Butter Cake:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/15/dining/15COOKING-BUTTERCAKE2/15COOKING-BUTTERCAKE2-articleLarge-v2.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - Grated zest and juice of 2 lemons
  - 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
  - 4 extra-large eggs
  - 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed
  - 9 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
  - 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour
  - 1 cup plus 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar
  - 1 teaspoon baking powder
  - 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 2 extra-large eggs
  - 1/2 cup ground toasted almonds
  - 2 tablespoons toasted sliced almonds
  - About 1/2 cup heavy cream for garnish
  - 1 tablespoon almond liqueur (optional)
  Instructions: 'For the curd, combine zest, juice, sugar and eggs in a heatproof
    bowl, and beat well. Add butter, and place over a saucepan full of simmering water.
    Cook, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until mixture
    thickens into curd, about 5 minutes. Strain into a bowl, and press plastic wrap
    onto surface to keep skin from forming. Refrigerate until cool, at least 1 1/2
    hours.

    Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 9-inch spring-form pan with 1 tablespoon butter,
    and dust with 1 tablespoon flour, shaking out excess.

    With an electric mixer, cream the remaining butter and 1 cup sugar together until
    light and fluffy. Sift together the remaining flour, baking powder and salt, and
    stir in. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs until they start to foam. Do not overbeat
    or the cake will be tough. Add eggs and ground almonds to batter, and mix well.

    Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Drop 8 individual tablespoons lemon curd
    around perimeter of batter, leaving a 1-inch border, and taking care to space
    drops evenly. Drop 3 to 4 tablespoons curd into center of batter. Refrigerate
    remaining curd for another use. Sprinkle cake with toasted almonds and 1 to 2
    tablespoons sugar, depending on taste.

    Bake until cake is toasty brown on top and a toothpick inserted into cake (not
    curd) comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool on rack 10 minutes, then remove
    sides of pan, and cool completely.

    Whip cream with almond liqueur. Present cake at table, and offer whipped cream
    on the side.'

  Ingredients:
  - 2 cups sliced almonds
  - 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 2 to 4 lemons)
  - Kosher salt
  - 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil
  - 4 cloves garlic, crushed with the flat side of a knife, peeled and left whole
  - 10 to 12 ounces washed and dried kale leaves, thick stems removed (weight after
    trimming)
  - 1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmesan (optional)
  Instructions: 'In a toaster oven or skillet, toast almonds until golden brown and
    fragrant. Set aside to cool.

    In a bowl, combine lemon juice and 1 heaping teaspoon salt. Slowly whisk in olive
    oil. Add garlic cloves and set aside to steep.

    Working in batches, cut the kale into thin ribbons: gather a large handful of
    leaves, bunch together tightly, and use the other hand to slice into 1/4-inch-thick
    pieces. This need not be done very precisely or neatly; the idea is to end up
    with a kind of slaw. (Recipe can be made up to this point 1 day ahead. Keep kale
    and dressing refrigerated separately.)

    Place chopped kale in a very large bowl. Sprinkle surface with almonds and then
    with cheese, if using. Remove and discard garlic cloves from dressing. Pour half
    the dressing over the salad and toss. Taste for dressing and salt and add more
    as needed, tossing to coat thoroughly. Serve within 1 hour.'

  Ingredients:
  - 3 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1 large onion, diced
  - 1 large carrot, diced
  - 1 bunch sturdy greens, such as kale, broccoli rabe, mustard greens or collard
    greens
  - 1 tablespoon tomato paste
  - 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin, plus more to taste
  - 1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste
  - 1/2 pound ground turkey
  - 3 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
  - 1 quart chicken stock
  - 2 (15-ounce) cans white beans, drained and rinsed
  - 1 cup chopped fresh, soft herbs, such as parsley, mint, dill, basil, tarragon,
    chives or a combination
  - Fresh lemon juice, to taste
  Instructions: "Heat a large pot over medium-high for a minute or so to warm it up.\
    \ Add the oil and heat until it thins out, about 30 seconds. Add onion and carrot,\
    \ and saut\xE9 until very soft and brown at the edges, 7 to 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile,\
    \ rinse the greens and pull the leaves off the stems. Tear or chop into bite-size\

    \ cumin and 1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes to the pot, and saut\xE9 until paste\

    Add the greens to the pot and simmer until they are very soft. This will take\
    \ 5 to 10 minutes for most greens, but tough collard greens might take 15 minutes.\

"Marcella Hazan\u2019s Bolognese Sauce":
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/27/dining/ElCerrito_ThePasta2/ElCerrito_ThePasta2-articleLarge.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  - 3 tablespoons butter plus 1 tablespoon for tossing the pasta
  - 1/2 cup chopped onion
  - 2/3 cup chopped celery
  - 2/3 cup chopped carrot
  - 3/4 pound ground beef chuck (or you can use 1 part pork to 2 parts beef)
  - Salt
  - Black pepper, ground fresh from the mill
  - 1 cup whole milk
  - Whole nutmeg
  - 1 cup dry white wine
  - 1 1/2 cups canned imported Italian plum tomatoes, cut up, with their juice
  - 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds pasta
  - Freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese at the table
  Instructions: 'Put the oil, butter and chopped onion in the pot and turn the heat
    on to medium. Cook and stir the onion until it has become translucent, then add
    the chopped celery and carrot. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring vegetables to
    coat them well.

    Add ground beef, a large pinch of salt and a few grindings of pepper. Crumble
    the meat with a fork, stir well and cook until the beef has lost its raw, red
    color.

    Add milk and let it simmer gently, stirring frequently, until it has bubbled away
    completely. Add a tiny grating -- about 1/8 teaspoon -- of nutmeg, and stir.

    Add the wine, let it simmer until it has evaporated, then add the tomatoes and
    stir thoroughly to coat all ingredients well. When the tomatoes begin to bubble,
    turn the heat down so that the sauce cooks at the laziest of simmers, with just
    an intermittent bubble breaking through to the surface. Cook, uncovered, for 3
    hours or more, stirring from time to time. While the sauce is cooking, you are
    likely to find that it begins to dry out and the fat separates from the meat.
    To keep it from sticking, add 1/2 cup of water whenever necessary. At the end,
    however, no water at all must be left and the fat must separate from the sauce.
    Taste and correct for salt.

    Toss with cooked drained pasta, adding the tablespoon of butter, and serve with
    freshly grated Parmesan on the side.'

No-Knead Bread:
  Image: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/16/dining/mb-no-knead-bread/mb-no-knead-bread-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg
  Ingredients:
  - 3 1/3 cups/430 grams all-purpose or bread flour, plus more for dusting
  - Generous 1/4 teaspoon/1 gram instant yeast
  - 2 teaspoons/8 grams kosher salt
  - Cornmeal or wheat bran, as needed
  Instructions: 'In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 1/2 cups/345
    grams water and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl
    with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm
    room temperature, about 70 degrees.

    Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface
    and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on
    itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.

    Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your
    fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton
    towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side
    down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton
    towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than
    double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.

    At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6-
    to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as
    it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand
    under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess,
    but that is OK. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will
    straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid
    and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on
    a rack.'

  Ingredients:
  - 153 grams 00 flour (1 cup plus 1 tablespoon)
  - 153 grams all-purpose flour (1 cup plus 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons)
  - 8 grams fine sea salt (1 teaspoon)
  - 2 grams active dry yeast (3/4 teaspoon)
  - 4 grams extra-virgin olive oil (1 teaspoon)
  Instructions: 'In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.

    In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams (a little less than 1 cup) lukewarm
    tap water, the yeast and the olive oil, then pour it into flour mixture. Knead
    with your hands until well combined, approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture
    rest for 15 minutes.

    Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into
    a ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with dampened cloth, and let
    rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the
    refrigerator. (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before
    you begin to shape it for pizza.)

    To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and use your
    fingers to stretch it, then your hands to shape it into rounds or squares. Top
    and bake.'

  Ingredients:
  - 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter
  - 4 tablespoons minced chervil, parsley or dill
  - 1 salmon fillet, 1 1/2 to 2 pounds
  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
  - Lemon wedges
  Instructions: 'Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Place the butter and half the herb
    in a roasting pan just large enough to fit the salmon and place it in the oven.
    Heat about 5 minutes, until the butter melts and the herb begins to sizzle.

    Add the salmon to the pan, skin side up. Roast 4 minutes. Remove from the oven,
    then peel the skin off. (If the skin does not lift right off, cook 2 minutes longer.)
    Sprinkle with salt and pepper and turn the fillet over. Sprinkle with salt and
    pepper again.

    Roast 3 to 5 minutes more, depending on the thickness of the fillet and the degree
    of doneness you prefer. Cut into serving portions, spoon a little of the butter
    over each and garnish with the remaining herb. Serve with lemon wedges.'

  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 pound linguine fini or other long, thin pasta
  - 4 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling
  - 2 shallots, thinly sliced into rings
  - 1 1/4 pounds Sun Gold, cherry or grape tomatoes
  - 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
  - Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)
  - 1 pound large sea scallops, patted dry
  - 1 1/2 cups roughly chopped mixed herbs, such as tarragon, mint, parsley and chives,
    plus more for serving
  Instructions: 'Bring a large pot of well-salted water (2 heaping tablespoons kosher
    salt to about 7 quarts water) to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package
    instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking water, then drain
    pasta.

    Wipe out the pot and heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium. Add the shallots
    and cook until they begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook,
    stirring occasionally, until they start to burst, 5 to 7 minutes. Add about 1/3
    cup reserved pasta water, and press the tomatoes gently with the back of a spatula
    or wooden spoon to get them nice and jammy. Stir in the garlic and red-pepper
    flakes, if using, and cook, allowing the sauce to simmer, 1 to 2 minutes. Season
    with salt and pepper; set aside.

    Season the scallops well on both sides with salt and pepper. In a 12-inch skillet,
    heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over high. When the oil shimmers, add
    the scallops, working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, and cook until golden
    brown and crisp, flipping once, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

    Add the pasta, 1 1/2 cups herbs and 1/4 cup reserved pasta water to the pot with
    the tomatoes and toss to coat, adding additional pasta water if needed. Divide
    the pasta among shallow bowls and top with scallops. Garnish with additional herbs
    and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired.'

    Set aside. (I blanch the kale to extract some of the bitterness, but you can skip
    this step if you wish).

    Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat in a large ovenproof casserole.
    Add the onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender,
    about five minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds
    to a minute. Add the dissolved tomato paste, and bring to a simmer.

    Mix together the remaining olive oil and the bread crumbs. Sprinkle the bread
    crumbs over the beans, and continue to bake another 30 minutes to an hour until
    the bread crumbs are lightly browned. Remove from the heat and serve; or allow

  Ingredients:
  - 1 3-to-3 1/2-pound butternut squash
  - 2 tablespoons canola oil
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 2 sprigs sage
  - 1 cup thinly sliced leeks
  - 1/2 cup thinly sliced carrots
  - 1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots
  - 1/2 cup thinly sliced onions
  - 6 garlic cloves, smashed
  - 2 tablespoons honey
  - 6 cups vegetable stock, more if needed
  - Bouquet Garni made of 8 sprigs thyme, 2 sprigs Italian parsley, 2 bay leaves and
    1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns, all wrapped in a packet made of 2 green leek leaves
  - "1/4 cup cr\xE8me fra\xEEche"
  - Freshly grated nutmeg
  - 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 1 tablespoon minced chives
  - Extra-virgin olive oil
  Instructions: "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a small baking sheet with aluminum\
    \ foil. Cut the neck off the squash and set it aside. Cut the bulb in half and\
    \ scoop out and discard seeds. Brush each half inside and out with about 1 1/2\
    \ teaspoons of the canola oil. Sprinkle the cavities with salt and pepper and\
    \ tuck a sprig of sage into each. Place cut-side-down on the baking sheet and\
    \ roast until completely tender, about 1 hour. Remove the squash from the oven\
    \ and let cool, then scoop out and reserve the flesh (discard sage).\nMeanwhile,\
    \ using a paring knife, peel away the skin from the neck of the squash until you\
    \ reach the bright orange flesh. Cut the flesh into 1/2-inch pieces (you should\
    \ have about 4 cups).\nPut the remaining canola oil in a stockpot over medium-high\
    \ heat, add the leeks, carrots, shallots and onions and cook, stirring often,\
    \ for about 6 minutes. Add the diced squash, garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and\
    \ 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook gently for 3 minutes, reducing the heat as necessary\
    \ to keep the garlic and squash from coloring. Stir in the honey and cook, stirring,\
    \ for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the stock and bouquet garni, bring to a simmer and cook\
    \ for 10 to 15 minutes or until the squash is tender.\nAdd the roasted squash\
    \ and simmer gently for about 30 minutes for the flavors to blend. Remove from\
    \ the heat and discard the bouquet garni. Transfer the soup to a blender, in batches,\
    \ and pur\xE9e. Strain the soup through a fine sieve into a bowl. Taste the soup\
    \ and adjust the seasoning. Let the soup cool, then refrigerate until ready to\
    \ serve.\nPlace the cr\xE8me fra\xEEche in a small chilled bowl and stir in nutmeg\
    \ to taste. Whisk until the cr\xE8me fra\xEEche holds a shape. Cover and refrigerate.\n\
    Gently reheat the soup until just hot. If it is too thick, add a little more vegetable\
    \ stock. Heat a medium skillet over high heat. When it is very hot, add the butter\
    \ and rotate the skillet over the heat as necessary to brown the butter evenly,\
    \ scraping up any bits that settle in the bottom. As soon as the butter is a hazelnut\
    \ brown, pour it into the pot of soup -- keep a safe distance, it may sputter\
    \ -- then stir.\nLadle the soup into six serving bowls. Top each with a dollop\
    \ of cr\xE8me fra\xEEche. Grind some black pepper over the top and sprinkle on\
    \ the chives. Drizzle a little olive oil over the top."
