  Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 pound linguine fini or other long, thin pasta
  - 4 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling
  - 2 shallots, thinly sliced into rings
  - 1 1/4 pounds Sun Gold, cherry or grape tomatoes
  - 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
  - Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)
  - 1 pound large sea scallops, patted dry
  - 1 1/2 cups roughly chopped mixed herbs, such as tarragon, mint, parsley and chives,
    plus more for serving
  Instructions: 'Bring a large pot of well-salted water (2 heaping tablespoons kosher
    salt to about 7 quarts water) to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package
    instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking water, then drain
    pasta.

    Wipe out the pot and heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium. Add the shallots
    and cook until they begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook,
    stirring occasionally, until they start to burst, 5 to 7 minutes. Add about 1/3
    cup reserved pasta water, and press the tomatoes gently with the back of a spatula
    or wooden spoon to get them nice and jammy. Stir in the garlic and red-pepper
    flakes, if using, and cook, allowing the sauce to simmer, 1 to 2 minutes. Season
    with salt and pepper; set aside.

    Season the scallops well on both sides with salt and pepper. In a 12-inch skillet,
    heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over high. When the oil shimmers, add
    the scallops, working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, and cook until golden
    brown and crisp, flipping once, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

    Add the pasta, 1 1/2 cups herbs and 1/4 cup reserved pasta water to the pot with
    the tomatoes and toss to coat, adding additional pasta water if needed. Divide
    the pasta among shallow bowls and top with scallops. Garnish with additional herbs
    and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired.'
